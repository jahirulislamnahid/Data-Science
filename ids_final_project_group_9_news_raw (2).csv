""We're not seeing the kind of structural transformation or reduction in anti-equity bias that would signal a meaningful shift in economic management,"" he said. He made the remarks at an event titled ""Bangladesh Economy 2025-26: Policy Reform and National Budget"", organised by the Citizens' Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, held at the Lakeshore Hotel in Dhaka. He said that the government has paid little attention to economic reforms compared to other types of reform. ""If there is no stability in the economy, no other reform will be sustainable,"" he said. Bhattacharya also pointed out that the upcoming budget for FY26 would be shaped by three key deficits: a lack of cooperation and inclusivity, poor coordination, and limited transparency. ""There has been minimal public engagement in the budget-making process. We saw no real dialogue outside Dhaka, nor substantial inclusion of diverse groups even within the capital,"" he said. On the issue of separating tax policy from administration, Bhattacharya said the reform initiatives should involve broader consultations with multiple stakeholders and be carried out transparently. ""The decision to divide it into two divisions is the right one, and it was also one of the recommendations in our white paper,"" he said. ""However, the way it has been implemented is not appropriate. It was done without proper consultation, by shrinking the space for professionals and increasing control over other administrative areas."" ""This approach is flawed, and implementing the reform properly has now become a matter of significant importance."" He added that the ongoing pen-down strike by NBR officials may further affect overall revenue collection.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:17 PM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:46 PM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/unemployment-rises-further-oct-dec-2024-3898031","Unemployment rises further in Oct-Dec 2024","Bangladesh's unemployment rate increased to 4.63 percent in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024-25, as a growing number of job seekers failed to secure employment, according to the latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) data. The jobless rate stood at 3.95 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) said yesterday. In the July-September quarter of fiscal year 2024-25, the unemployment rate was 4.49 percent, as economic activity nearly came to a halt amid a mass uprising that led to the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina regime and subsequent labour unrest in major industrial areas of Dhaka. The number of unemployed people was 2.66 million during the third quarter. This figure rose to 2.73 million in the October-December period, the BBS said. With this, the number of unemployed people rose to 2.7 million in 2024, up from 2.55 million the previous year. The overall unemployment rate last year was 4.48 percent, compared to 4.15 percent in 2023. The latest QLFS data also showed that the labour force participation rate declined in the fourth quarter of 2024 and throughout the year, mainly due to reduced participation of women in the workforce. In the October-December quarter of 2024, the labour force participation rate dropped to 48.41 percent from 50.27 percent a year earlier. During the full year, the labour force participation rate was 49.49 percent, compared to 50.92 percent in 2023. According to the BBS, of the 58.93 million people in the workforce in the fourth quarter of last year, 56.2 million were employed, a decline compared to the same period a year earlier.","Mon May 19, 2025 11:20 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:53 PM"

Their geographic closeness, economic links, and cross-border connectivity make this partnership strategically important. However, some recent policy decisions and reactions from both sides have raised serious concerns. Especially, the imposition of non-tariff barriers is creating new problems. These affect not only trade but also trust and regional stability. India has suddenly restricted certain Bangladeshi consumer goods—like fruit juice, processed foods, plastic items, and garments—through land ports in its northeast. In recent times, Bangladesh also imposed restrictions on importing Indian yarn through specific land ports. Though these are not direct tariff hikes, they work as port restrictions and certainly non-tariff barriers; they limit trade routes and make business operations harder. The withdrawal of transhipment facilities by India for Bangladesh has added more pressure. Importantly, India—including its northeast—is a valuable market for Bangladesh. There is steady demand there for Bangladeshi garments, food products, and plastics. These goods had long entered India by land without any major issues. Sudden limits now increase costs and hurt small and medium businesses near the border. Garments, a major export item for Bangladesh, may now rely on distant sea ports like Kolkata or Nhava Sheva. This raises transport costs, delays shipments, and hurts competitiveness. At the same time, Bangladesh depends on Indian yarn, a key raw material for its textile and garment industries. Any import barriers raise production costs and disrupt the local industry. Sudden, one-sided decisions harm both countries' industries and weaken the trust built over time. While each country has the right to control its trade, stability, prior notice, and reasonable coordination are essential in policymaking. Sudden trade barriers bring uncertainty for businesses and hurt the region's trade system. Long-established supply chains may break down. Such actions also risk damaging bilateral trust and cooperation. What's most needed now is a shift in mindset. These issues shouldn't be seen as rivalry or punishment. Instead, both countries should work together to find solutions. Both sides support regional unity, cross-border trade, and economic growth. So, the impact of non-tariff measures must be reviewed and reconsidered quickly. Governments, policymakers, trade bodies, and the private sector must strengthen dialogue to prevent future crises. A sustainable, inclusive, and streamlined trade framework is needed—one that reduces sudden disruptions and builds stronger business ties. Trade between Bangladesh and India is not just about their economic interests. It's vital for South Asia's unity, stability, and progress. This trade and business relationship must not weaken due to non-tariff barriers, lack of coordination, or reactive policies. The right path forward lies in dialogue, understanding, and long-term cooperation.","Mon May 19, 2025 11:29 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:51 PM"

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/chinas-xiaomi-invest-nearly-7-bn-chips-3898101","China's Xiaomi to invest nearly $7 bn in chips","Chinese tech giant Xiaomi will invest 50 billion yuan ($6.9 billion) in developing high-end smartphone chips, the firm's founder said on Monday. Xiaomi, which sells goods from smartphones to vacuum cleaners and EVs, is one of China's most prominent consumer electronics firms. Writing on social media platform WeChat to mark the 15th year since the company's establishment, Lei Jun said: ""chips are the underlying core track for Xiaomi to break through in cutting-edge technology, so we will definitely make an all-out effort"". In pursuit of Xiaomi's semiconductor ambitions, the firm has developed an investment plan involving ""at least 10 years of investment and at least 50 billion yuan"", Lei added. Xiaomi took initial steps into semiconductors for smartphones with the launch of the firm's first in-house chip -- the Surge S1 -- in 2017. But the group was forced to halt production of the chip due to technical and financial obstacles, and has since refocused on other components as well as a move into the electric vehicle sector. ""That is not our 'dark history'. That is the path we have travelled,"" wrote Lei on Monday. Since 2021, Xiaomi's chip development program has already received 13.5 billion yuan in research and development funds for a team of more than 2,500 employees, said the billionaire entrepreneur. The announcement comes in the face of heightened technological tensions between Beijing and Washington as both nations seek to ensure access to the most advanced components. A number of Chinese firms are racing to develop their own chips with the aim of freeing themselves from reliance on foreign suppliers in the face of that rivalry. ""Xiaomi has always had a 'chip dream',"" Lei wrote, adding: ""I earnestly request everyone to give us more time and patience to support our continued exploration on this road"".","Mon May 19, 2025 12:56 PM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 01:00 PM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/asian-markets-drop-after-us-loses-last-triple-credit-rating-3898066","Asian markets drop after US loses last triple-A credit rating","Asian stocks fell with the dollar Monday after Moody's removed the United States' last gold standard sovereign bond rating, citing the growing debt pile that it warned could balloon further. The move dealt a blow to markets, which had enjoyed a healthy run-up last week after Washington and China hammered out a deal to temporarily slash tit-for-tat tariffs, dialling down the tensions in a painful trade war between the superpowers. After the rout sparked by US President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariffs bazooka, investors have in recent weeks raced back to buy up beaten-down stocks as the White House tempered its hardball tariff approach and then announced the agreement with China. But selling pressure returned Monday after Moody's cut its rating on US debt to Aa1 from Aaa, noting ""the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns"". It added that it expected federal deficits to widen to almost nine percent of economic output by 2035, up from 6.4 percent last year, ""driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation"". Analysts said the cut in the gold standard rating -- which follows S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023 -- could indicate investors will want higher yields on Treasuries, pushing up the cost of government debt. Still, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed the announcement, saying it was ""a lagging indicator"" and blaming Trump's predecessor Joe Biden. ""We didn't get here in the past 100 days,"" he told CNN. ""It's the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 percent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren't in a recession, not in a war."" And White House communications director Steven Cheung hit out at Moody's Analytics on X, singling out its chief economist Mark Zandi. ""Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,"" Cheung posted. The news added to a frustrating time for the US president after Congress failed to pass his ""big, beautiful bill"" to extend tax cuts passed in his first term and impose new restrictions on welfare programmes. Independent congressional analysts say the package would add more than $4.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the coming decade. The bill came up short in a key vote owing to opposition from several Republican fiscal hawks. Republican congressman French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said the downgrade ""is a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order"". House Speaker Mike Johnson told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he plans for a floor vote on the package by the end of the week. Equities in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell as below-forecast Chinese retail sales figures reinforced the view that the world's number two economy continues to struggle even after officials unveiled fresh stimulus measures. However, factory output picked up more than expected. Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei and Jakarta all fell, while US futures were also well down. The dollar was also down against its peers. Gold recovered some recent losses owing to its safe haven appeal, rising to $3,225 per ounce. Still, National Australia Bank's Ray Attrill said: ""Moody's actions will have zero impact on any investor's ability or willingness to continue holding US Treasuries -- that would likely require downgrades of four or five more notches."" And SPI Asset Management's Stephen Innes said investors would be more interested in upcoming data that would provide a better idea about the state of the world's top economy. ""Moody's may have dropped the mic, but for equity traders, the real test this week will be Main Street,"" he wrote in a note. ""We're heading into a make-or-break retail earnings slate -- Target, Home Depot, Lowe's, TJX, Ralph Lauren all report -- and this is where tariff theory collides with checkout-line reality. ""Yes, the S&P has clawed back 18 percent since the 'Liberation Day' tariff blitz, but the consumer has been the market's unsung hero. Now they're about to be audited."" He said the ""downgrade is more psychological than mechanical"".","Mon May 19, 2025 11:58 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:03 PM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/high-inflation-costly-loans-force-firms-cut-spending-3897896","High inflation, costly loans force firms to cut spending","From mild steel rods to electronics and food products, advertisements in newspapers and on televisions have decreased as businesses say they have tightened their belts to weather stubbornly high inflation, the steep devaluation of the local currency, and punishingly high bank interest rates. Besides, some manufacturers say they are now opting to reduce office utility consumption, optimise office supplies, minimise bank dependence, and find alternative funding sources. Others are taking a closer look at operational expenses, trimming excess spending, and trying to get the maximum output with limited resources. ""The situation is really difficult,"" said Md Nurul Afsar, deputy managing director of Electro Mart Group, a manufacturer and marketer of electronics and home appliances. In recent months, Electro Mart has scaled back its promotional activities, including newspaper and television ads, as part of a cost-cutting strategy. Despite mounting financial pressures, the company has refrained from raising product prices, fearing that such a move could impact sales amid the inflationary pinch. ""Instead, we are focusing on cost-effective measures,"" said Afsar. The top executive said that the company is being squeezed by bank interest rates as high as 17 percent, severely impacting profit margins. Three years ago, banks used to charge single-digit interest on loans, exchange rates were around Tk 80, and inflation was roughly 6–7 percent. ""Due to the high interest rates over the previous years, our business margins have shrunk significantly. We are trying to cut unnecessary expenses wherever possible to absorb the extra burden,"" he told The Daily Star. This effort includes limiting utility usage, optimising office supplies, and cutting down on non-essential expenditures. ""We are reducing costs across all minor areas of daily office expenses — wherever there is room to save,"" he said. Similarly, BSRM Steels Limited is adopting a number of cost-cutting measures to cope with rising bank interest rates and brutal inflation, said Tapan Sengupta, the company's deputy managing director. ""We are trying to manage the impact of high bank interest and inflation by cutting costs in every area and making optimal use of technology,"" Sengupta told The Daily Star. According to him, the steelmaker is focusing on cost efficiency by trimming daily expenses while ensuring employee salaries remain unaffected. ""We are only spending on cost-effective areas that provide value for money. For instance, our marketing budget has been scaled back,"" he said. However, avoiding high bank interest is not feasible, as borrowing is essential for business investment, he mentioned. ""There is no escaping bank interest rates. Borrowing to run the business is a necessary part of investment, so the high rates must be managed,"" he added. Meanwhile, leading conglomerate PRAN-RFL Group is trying to reduce its reliance on bank loans to minimise the impact. ""We have had to cut down on bank borrowing, reduce costs, and think outside the box just to survive,"" said Ahsan Khan Chowdhury, the group's CEO. ""Doing business in this climate has become extremely challenging."" According to him, the company has focused on lowering production costs, reducing dependency on bank financing, and exploring alternative sources of funds. ""Our employees have been working tirelessly, and we are continuously applying innovative approaches to control costs and improve efficiency,"" he said. Chowdhury said that the fight against red-hot inflation by raising bank interest rates over the past two years has severely hurt small and medium enterprises. Meanwhile, Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez, president of the Bangladesh Chamber of Industries (BCI), said soaring utility bills are further compounding the challenges for businesses. Regarding the small and medium business segment, Parvez said that gas and electricity price hikes have pushed up production costs, while high bank interest rates are making it nearly impossible for them to survive. Given such conditions, domestic producers are being forced to raise prices, directly burdening consumers already struggling with high living costs, he added. As a result, sales and profit margins have plummeted compared to last year, a trend clearly reflected in the quarterly reports of listed companies. ""If listed firms are struggling this much, one can only imagine the plight of unlisted ones,"" Parvez added. Citing a recent BCI assessment of the business environment under the current political context, Parvez cautioned of deep stagnation without urgent policy actions.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:35 PM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/bangladesh-budget-2025-26/news/10-segments-get-52-adp-3897776","10 segments to get 52% of ADP","As much as 52 percent of the Tk 2,30,000 crore annual development programme (ADP) for the upcoming fiscal year will be spent on just 10 key segments, including government buildings, electrification, land acquisition and infrastructure. For the first time, the planning ministry has used a digital budget planning system to categorise spending based on economic codes, allowing for more transparent tracking of fund utilisation, according to a presentation made by the planning ministry during yesterday's National Economic Council meeting. The development budget for fiscal 2025-26 was approved at the meeting chaired by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus. Under the digital budget planning method, the allocations will be tracked and implemented through the iBAS++ system, ensuring code-based expenditure. According to the planning ministry, Tk 28,018 crore will be spent only for non-residential government buildings and another Tk 9,016 crore will be spent for residential buildings under all the ministries and divisions. In addition, the segment of other buildings and establishments would cost Tk 6,917 crore. About Tk 16,073 crore would be spent on the buildings' electrification. Another Tk 15,828 crore will be spent on land acquisition for various projects. Some Tk 6,505 crore would be spent to build bridges and Tk 6,473 crore for dams. Another Tk 17,358 crore would be spent on building roads and highways, while rural roads will cost another Tk 9,021 crore. The government has allocated Tk 9,627 crore for research and development purposes. Next fiscal year's ADP is Tk 14,000 crore more than the revised allocation for this year. Of the total, Tk 144,000 crore will come from domestic resources -- lower than the Tk 1,59,000 crore sought by ministries -- while foreign funding remains unchanged at Tk 86,000 crore. Both figures reflect year-on-year declines of 12.7 percent and 14 percent respectively. State-owned enterprises have been allocated Tk 8,000 crore, nearly half of their original outlay in the current year. The government has allocated 70 percent of the ADP budget to five sectors: the transport and communication (Tk 58,973 crore), power and energy (Tk 32,392 crore), education (Tk 28,557 crore), housing and community (Tk 22,776 crore) and health (Tk 18,148 crore). Among the government's ministries and divisions, the top 10 ministries got 74 percent of the total ADP allocation in the upcoming fiscal year. The local government division got the highest allocation (Tk 36,098 crore), followed by the road transport and highways (Tk 32,329 crore), power division (Tk 20,283 crore), secondary and higher education division (Tk 13,625 crore), science and technology ministry (12,154 crore) and health service division (Tk 11,617 crore). ""It will be a budget for restoring discipline in the financial sector,"" said Planning Adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud after the meeting. Though the budget size would be relatively small, it is designed to restore economic stability, control inflation and reintroduce discipline and sustainability in budget management. ""Our objective is to avoid falling into a debt trap, where a significant portion of the budget is consumed by loan repayments -- be it operating costs or interest payments."" To break this vicious cycle, revenue must be increased, but expenditure must also remain limited. ""We aim to keep the budget deficit below 4 percent of total GDP."" Education and health have received special attention in the budget. The development budget for the two sectors would not increase, but the revenue budget would increase to accommodate teachers' higher salaries and the appointment of 2,500 new health workers, including doctors. ""In the health sector, despite many facilities being built, many are non-operational due to a lack of doctors or equipment. So instead of more infrastructure, we are focusing on operating these through the revenue budget,"" he said. The government will increase allocation so that the non-government teachers' outstanding retirement benefits and welfare payments that have been pending for the last 5–6 years can be cleared immediately. No long-term mega projects are being included in the development budget. Although this year's development budget is smaller in nominal terms than last year's proposed budget, it is more realistic, he said. ""There was a lot of waste and inefficiency. We are now streamlining, downsizing and redesigning to reduce costs."" The budget would be announced on June 2, when the tax measures of the budget become effective immediately. As there is no parliament existing now, there will be windows for tax measures' corrections until the Finance Bill is announced through ordinances.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:14 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 11:14 AM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/nbr-may-continue-prospective-tax-system-till-fy28-3897891","BUDGET FY26 / NBR may continue prospective tax system till FY28","The National Board of Revenue (NBR) is expected to continue the prospective tax system until fiscal year 2027-28, allowing taxpayers and businesses to determine applicable tax rates in advance instead of waiting until the end of the income year. Starting with the national budget for FY25, the government shifted from a retrospective to a prospective tax regime, aiming to support better investment and tax planning. Under the traditional retrospective system, the NBR announced tax rates for firms and individuals only after the completion of an income year. For instance, the current income year runs from July 2024 to June 2025. Under the earlier system, taxpayers would file their income and wealth statements and pay taxes for the assessment year, in this case FY25, in the following year, based on rates announced after the income year ended. However, under the prospective system, individuals and businesses can calculate their tax liabilities for the income year in advance and pay taxes by the end of the same income year. The NBR is expected to adopt the prospective system in response to longstanding taxpayer demands, a finance ministry official, requesting anonymity, told The Daily Star recently. ""After FY25 and FY26, we are planning to introduce it for another two years. We are working on it,"" the official said. He added that this system would help build confidence among individuals and investors by allowing them to plan their tax management and investment plans. On May 15, Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed gave the nod to the proposal, which may be presented to Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus today, the official said. Investors and tax analysts welcomed the NBR's move, saying it would boost investor confidence and encourage local and foreign investment. ""If it truly happens, this will be wonderful news indeed,"" said Zaved Akhtar, president of the Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). ""It helps businesses plan better and ensure business plans reflect realities,"" he said. ""There are no sudden surprises. I am hoping that prospective tax visibility also helps in reducing the effective tax rates as well,"" added Zaved, also the chairman and managing director of Unilever Bangladesh Limited. According to Zaved, it was previously quite difficult to assess a year's tax using rates announced at the end of the income year, as companies had already closed their books and, in many cases, disbursed dividends. ""Knowing future tax rates reduces uncertainty, enabling more confident decisions about savings, investments, and debt management,"" said Snehasish Barua, managing director of SMAC Advisory Services. A clearer understanding of upcoming tax obligations empowers individuals and businesses to plan their long-term finances more effectively, he said. Barua added that it also allows for proactive planning that can yield significant tax savings. However, in Bangladesh, simply knowing the rates in advance may not benefit taxpayers if the rates are not rationalised and the effective tax rates remain higher than the statutory rates. Mohammed Humayun Kabir, vice-president of the South Asian Federation of Accountants, also welcomed the move. ""This policy continuation will work as a positive initiative for attracting local and foreign investors,"" he said. If the country can draw investment, it will positively impact employment generation, Kabir added. Kabir, also a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh, hoped the NBR would continue this policy even after FY28. Currently, Bangladesh has nearly 1.13 crore Taxpayers' Identification Number (TIN) holders. However, around 60 percent of those taxpayers did not submit returns in the current fiscal year.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 10:04 AM"

Its earnings per share (EPS) declined to Tk 0.32 in the January-March period from Tk 0.35 in the same period a year earlier. The bank attributed the fall in EPS to an increase in expenses.

The increase in NOCFPS was driven by higher deposits from customers and a reduction in loans and advances, the bank said in the financial statement. Trust Bank saw significant growth in its income from investments, which surged 91 percent year-on-year to Tk 313.26 crore in the first quarter, mainly due to increased investments in treasury bills and bonds. Its commission, exchange and brokerage income rose by 25 percent year-on-year to Tk 96.99 crore, supported by higher exchange gains on foreign currencies, as per the financial statement. Trust Bank's provisions against loans and advances and other accounts stood at Tk 214.70 crore, up 7 percent from the same quarter a year ago, owing to a rise in classified loans.

Banks traded the greenback at Tk 122.78 per dollar, up from Tk 122.60 the previous day, according to Bangladesh Bank data. The interbank selling rate was Tk 122 per dollar on Wednesday last week, when the central bank introduced the market-driven framework — a key requirement tied to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) $4.7 billion loan programme. Central bank officials described the current situation as stable and credited a higher inflow of US dollars in recent months. Most banks are now selling dollars to importers at Tk 122.70, while buying them from exporters and exchange houses at rates of Tk 122.30–Tk 122.50 per dollar. Contacted, Bangladesh Bank Executive Director and Spokesperson Arief Hossain Khan said the central bank is monitoring the foreign exchange market, which is steady due to a surge in remittance inflows and export earnings. ""We are closely observing the market to prevent any manipulation,"" he told The Daily Star, adding that the central bank has warned banks against any such activities. As part of the shift to a market-based exchange rate, the central bank on May 14 lifted the Tk 1 spread between the buying and selling rates of the US dollar, rescinding a directive issued in January. At the same time, it reinstated a circular from December 2024, allowing banks to negotiate dollar rates for both interbank and customer transactions. This move reinstates a pricing framework determined by market demand and supply. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior treasury official at a private bank said that the central bank and other regulatory bodies have urged market players to act prudently given the currency situation. ""With Eid-ul-Azha approaching, dollar inflows are expected to increase. There is general confidence that the market will remain stable,"" the official said. At a recent event, Bangladesh Bank Deputy Governor Md Habibur Rahman said the central bank would step in if exchange rates rise beyond acceptable levels. ""We have the necessary tools to intervene,"" Rahman said, adding that despite slight fluctuations in the exchange rate following the shift to a market-driven system, no major taka depreciation has occurred. ""There is no pressure for devaluation at the moment,"" he said. ""We will continue to monitor the situation closely.""","Mon May 19, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 01:04 AM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/maize-farmers-lament-price-drop-amid-rise-costs-3897881","Maize farmers lament price drop amid a rise in costs","Maize cultivation remains a profitable venture for farmers, although many in districts where production is concentrated have voiced concerns over a drop in market prices this season amid a rise in production costs. The crop's cultivation is concentrated in the country's northern region, with the leading districts being Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur, Chuadanga, Thakurgaon, Rangpur, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Jhenaidah, Jamalpur and Gaibandha. Farmers in Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Rangpur and Dinajpur report that prices have declined by Tk 2 to Tk 3 from those in the previous season to Tk 28 to Tk 29 per kilogramme (kg). The cost of production has increased by a similar margin to Tk 11 to Tk 13 per kg. In terms of land area or every bigha (2,529 square metres), the cost stands between Tk 14,000 and Tk 16,000, subject to variations due to land lease rates and ancillary expenses. A typical yield per bigha ranges from 35 maunds to 45 maunds (one maund equals around 37 kg). Each maund sells for Tk 1,100 to Tk 1,300. This results in net profits of approximately Tk 28,000 to Tk 34,000 per bigha, cementing maize's status as one of the most financially viable crops. Nevertheless, traders are reportedly purchasing maize at lower prices this year, citing acreage expansion and a bumper harvest. Farmers argue that while yields are indeed robust, the combination of reduced prices and increased input costs is eroding their profit margins and may deter future planting. Such volatility has prompted calls for more stable pricing mechanisms and fairer market access—factors that many believe are crucial to the long-term sustainability of maize farming. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Bangladesh produced 68.84 lakh tonnes of maize from 6.42 lakh hectares of land in fiscal year 2023–24. The target for fiscal year 2024–25 has been set at 71.60 lakh tonnes from 6.51 lakh hectares of land. National demand currently hovers around 70 lakh tonnes to 75 lakh tonnes. Agricultural economist Jahangir Alam noted, ""Last year, we had to import four lakh tonnes of maize. This year, dependency on imports will reduce. Until domestic production satisfies national demand, expansion must continue."" He cautioned that increased production combined with falling global prices could further depress domestic prices. A government-fixed market price for maize would be beneficial, he added, describing the crop as a mode of cash generation that has reinvigorated rural economies. In the Rangpur region, comprising Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Rangpur and Nilphamari, maize has been cultivated on 1.47 lakh hectares of land this year with a production target of 15.60 lakh tonnes. Notably, approximately half of this is char areas—fertile floodplains prone to seasonal submersion. In Lalmonirhat, maize is cultivated on 39,505 hectares, primarily on the sandy char lands of the Teesta river. Many local farmers have seen transformative improvements in their livelihoods through maize cultivation. Shafiqul Islam, additional director of the DAE's Rangpur division, explained that maize was predominantly cultivated during the Rabi (winter) season, with planting running in October–November and harvests in March–April. The season benefits from favourable weather and allows companion cropping. Although some cultivation occurs in the Kharif or monsoon season, yields are typically lower. Shahidar Rahman, a seasoned farmer of Char Saniajan in Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha upazila, has been growing maize on 10 bighas of sandy land along the Teesta for 15 years. ""I've harvested 43 maunds per bigha on eight bighas so far, spending a total of Tk 2.8 lakh. Without maize, I would still be mired in poverty,"" he said. Similarly, Afiar Rahman of Char Bhotmari in Lalmonirhat's Kaliganj upazila voiced disappointment over this year's price drop. ""If prices matched last year's, we could have earned much more,"" he said, informing that he had harvested 326 maunds from eight bighas, incurring a cost of Tk 1.28 lakh. Wholesalers also noted tight profit margins. Jamilur Rahman of Chilmari, Kurigram, said, ""We buy maize at Tk 27–28 per kg and sell it to feed mills for Tk 29. After transport, our margin is minimal."" He cited abundant supply and increased cultivation as factors driving the price dip. Bablu Mia, a wholesaler in Bhotmari, echoed this, stating, ""Transport costs from the char areas are high. I buy from char farmers at Tk 27 and sell at Tk 29. With strong yields, prices could fall further."" From the industry side, Azizar Rahman, a procurement representative of Aftab Feed Mill, explained that purchases were aligned with global trends. ""We prioritise local produce over imports. If global prices rise, farmers will benefit domestically,"" he said. Afzal Hossain, a Rangpur-based feed producer, noted that despite robust production, feed prices are unlikely to drop due to high bank interest rates, service charges and other operating costs. Procurement centres in high-output areas enable direct purchases from farmers, improving supply chain efficiency, he said. Mizanur Haque, senior vice-president of Bangladesh Maize Association, warned of growing monopolistic behaviour. ""Previously, we could ensure fair returns for farmers. Now, syndicates led by feed mill owners are dictating prices,"" he claimed. He added that falling global wheat prices and increased maize production have further suppressed the market.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 01:00 AM"

""We have learned through the media that the finance adviser (Salehuddin Ahmed) will sit for a discussion with the NBR officials on Tuesday,"" said Sehela Siddiqua, additional commissioner of the NBR. ""But we are yet to receive any formal or specific proposal. If we get any formal proposal from the CA or his representatives, we will send a team for the discussion. Without the CA's concern, we won't sit for discussion,"" she added. ""Based on the circumstances, our strike will continue tomorrow (Monday) in the same manner, from 9:00am to 3:00pm,"" she said. Siddiqua made the announcement at a press briefing at the NBR headquarters in Agargaon to press home their three-point demand, including the repeal of the ordinance.  Revenue activities for import and export have been disrupted nationwide, posing a serious risk to overall revenue collection and business operations The other demands are for the public disclosure of a state advisory committee's report on reforms required for the NBR, which was submitted to the finance ministry, and inclusive, consultative, and sustainable reforms for the revenue administration. Yesterday, the strike was observed for the fourth consecutive day, led by the ""NBR Reform Unity Council"", a platform of cadre and non-cadre officials. Meanwhile, revenue activities — including import and export — have been disrupted nationwide, posing a serious risk to overall revenue collection and causing significant setbacks for regular business operations. Business leaders warn that if the situation persists, it could lead to delays in the release of imported raw materials, shortages of essential goods, and disruptions to industrial production. According to sources in the NBR, officials at 25 customs stations — including the Chattogram and Mongla ports and Kamalapur Inland Container Depot — and over 100 VAT, customs, and tax offices nationwide were observing the strike. While export consignments are still being processed, importers say they have been unable to avail their goods, affecting exports that rely on imported raw materials. Shawkat Osman, owner of Silver Steel Company, said his imports arrived at the Chattogram port in eight containers on May 14 but he has been unable to receive them. ""Customs officials usually work from 9:00am to 8:00pm, but now they are leaving by 5:00pm,"" he said. ""With only two active hours from 3:00pm to 5:00pm, I couldn't get physical inspections conducted. Without it, I can't clear customs or pay duties to release my goods,"" he said. Osman also noted that his container demurrage and port charges amounted to around Tk 1.5 lakh per day. Several clearing and forwarding agents echoed similar concerns, stating that while exports were technically exempt from the strike, the slowdown was affecting outbound shipments as well. The inability to take away imported raw materials is already having a knock-on effect on export orders. Mohammad Saidul Islam, deputy commissioner of Chattogram Custom House, said directives have been issued to ensure that no file remains stuck at any desk after the work abstention hours. ""Officials have been instructed to process and release files before leaving office, even if it means staying back after 5:00pm,"" he said. He also claimed that export operations and airport services have remained functional during the protest, and his office has not received any official complaint regarding the issue. However, with 78 percent of the country's imports and 84 percent of the country's exports passing through the Chattogram port, any disruption in import clearance has a ripple effect across the entire economy, business leaders warned. According to data from Chattogram Custom House, the average number of import consignment assessments and inspections per day has dropped by half over the past four days — from around 4,000 to approximately 2,000. Without assessment and inspection, importers are unable to receive their goods. According to customs data of May 13, some 3,460 import bills of entry were processed, whereas the number fell to 1,874 the next day — the first day of the strike. The number stood at 1,897 on May 15 and 1,895 on May 17. Yesterday, customs activities remained suspended until 3:00pm due to the ongoing strike, officials said. The number of containers at the yards increased by 1,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) during the same period, rising from 40,708 TEUs on May 15 to 41,695 TEUs on May 18.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 04:37 AM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/only-splitting-the-nbr-may-not-help-3897856","Only splitting the NBR may not help","Bangladesh's government recently enacted a long-awaited reform measure: dissolving the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and splitting it into two new agencies. The goal is to separate the tax policymaking and implementation processes, in line with a key conditionality of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the next tranche of disbursements. With a dismal revenue-GDP ratio, a narrow tax base, and bias towards indirect taxes, an overhaul of the revenue administration has been overdue for many years, and many of us have been talking about this. The government even formed a task force to look at the NBR and its activities more closely and recommend actions in order to bolster revenue growth. I had the opportunity to work closely with NBR seniors since the early nineties and was associated with many impactful reform projects there. Under the TACTS (tax administration capacity building and taxpayers' services) project, where we reviewed the revenue administration and structure in India and Thailand, we even talked about a possible split along the direct (corporate & income tax) and indirect taxes (customs & VAT) lines along with capacity building in those agencies to be able to handle leakages. Right scoping, planning, reaching out to the right target market, right communication, handling corruption and timely implementation have been issues with many agencies in Bangladesh, not only NBR. Existing NBR strength was severely constrained with day-to-day operational work, not much time available to think beyond and creatively for a visible revenue increase. My long interface with NBR as a large institutional and individual taxpayer, a faculty at the tax academy and other government set up as well as consultancy experience with World Bank and UKAID projects, I would also say that there had been serious jelling issues between NBR professionals and seniors coming from outside. By dissolving the NBR along with the Internal Resources Division (IRD) through an ordinance, the government is trying to pave the way for the Revenue Policy Division and Revenue Management Division.  The first will be tasked with designing the tax policy framework, formulating tax laws, determining various rates, and overseeing the coordination of international tax treaties and trade-related tariffs. The second, on the other hand, will be responsible for tax administration, compliance, audit, and enforcement of income tax, VAT, customs and other taxes and duties. The split of duties is deemed to make the tax system more efficient and increase overall revenue earnings. Until now, the NBR has been responsible for all these tasks – both policymaking and policy enforcement – something that has been criticised for creating an overlap of functions leading to poor revenue earning performance and coordination. As we know, Bangladesh has one of the lowest tax-GDP ratios in Asia (below 8 percent). The NBR has consistently failed to ensure effective resource mobilisation, increase revenue generation through direct taxes, and plug loopholes to prevent tax evasion, among other things. Moreover, in its objective to meet revenue collection targets, it has often ended up enforcing policies that created unjust and uneven pressure on taxpayers and businesses. However, merely overhauling the structure may not bear the desired results if the problems beneath the carpet are not addressed. Much has been said time and again, the government should reduce its overreliance on indirect taxes and expand the tax base to improve our tax-GDP ratio by bringing surplus-generating sectors and individuals under the tax net. Tax exemptions must also be reconsidered and allowed more judiciously, and corrupt practices in tax collection must be stopped. The entire system must be designed in a way that encourages eligible taxpayers so they can pay taxes without hassle. We saw NBR officials protesting against the move, arguing that the new ordinance sidelines experienced tax professionals and does not recognise their career progression issues. Many, however, feel this can be sorted out through dialogue and necessary readjustments. However, the ongoing reform and reconstruction drive must be followed through since it is in line with international best practices and the desire of the major stakeholders- development partners, domestic & foreign investors along with poor people hard pressed by large indirect tax-biased architecture.

Today, the inter-bank exchange rate (selling) stood at Tk 122.78 per US dollar, up from Tk 122.60 a day earlier, according to the central bank's latest data. The rate was Tk 122 on May 14, when the banking regulator announced the market-driven exchange rate.

Business leaders and economists have warned that if the situation continues, it could lead to a shortage of essential commodities in the local market and a breakdown in the industrial production cycle due to delays in releasing imported raw materials. According to NBR sources, officials from 25 customs stations—including Chattogram and Mongla ports and the Kamalapur Inland Container Depot (ICD)—as well as over 100 VAT, customs, and tax offices across the country have been observing a daily six-hour work abstention since May 14, from 9am to 3pm each day.

Revenue collection has also taken a hit. Since the beginning of the strike up to May 17, the NBR collected Tk 2,377.99 crore in revenue, compared to Tk 3,170.2 crore during the same period last year. Officials warned that if this continues, the NBR will fall significantly short of its current fiscal year target, with an estimated shortfall of Tk 71,000 crore. The government initially set a revenue target of Tk 4.8 lakh crore for the 2024–25 fiscal year, later revised to Tk 4.63 lakh crore. As of April 30, total collection stood at Tk 3.92 lakh crore.

His comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs. ""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,"" Trump said in a social media post. ""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING."" Walmart said it has always worked to keep its prices as low as possible, adding that this practice will not stop. ""We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise, which primarily comes from China, would not drive food prices higher. Many US companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations amid friction between the US and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending. As a bellwether of US consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low. Every week, 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90 percent of the US population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart. Walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon  planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:43 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 04:26 AM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/moodys-downgrade-intensifies-investor-worry-about-us-fiscal-path-3897866","Moody’s downgrade intensifies investor worry about US fiscal path","A US sovereign downgrade by Moody's has exacerbated investor worries about a looming debt time-bomb that could spur bond market vigilantes who want to see more fiscal restraint from Washington. The ratings agency cut America's pristine sovereign credit rating by one notch on Friday, the last of the major ratings agencies to downgrade the country, citing concerns about the nation's growing $36 trillion debt pile. The move came as Republicans who control the House of Representatives and the Senate seek to approve a sweeping package of tax cuts, spending hikes and safety-net reductions, which could add trillions to the US debt pile. Uncertainty over the final shape of the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" has investors on edge even as optimism has emerged over trade. The bill failed to clear a key hurdle on Friday even as US President Donald Trump called for unity around the legislation. ""The bond market has been keeping a sharp eye on what transpires in Washington this year in particular,"" said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, who said that Moody's downgrade may make investors more cautious. ""As Congress debates the 'big, beautiful bill' the bond vigilantes will be keeping a sharp eye on making them toe a fiscally responsible line,"" she said, referring to bond investors who punish bad policy by making it prohibitively expensive for governments to borrow. The downgrade from Moody's, which follows similar moves from Fitch in 2023 and Standard & Poor's in 2011, will ""eventually lead to higher borrowing costs for the public and private sector in the United States,"" said Spencer Hakimian, founder of Tolou Capital Management in New York. Even so, the ratings cut was unlikely to trigger forced selling from funds that can only invest in top-rated securities, said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities, as most funds revised guidelines after the S&P downgrade. ""But we expect it to refocus the market's attention on fiscal policy and the bill currently being negotiated in Congress,"" Goldberg said. US stocks closed higher on Friday, with the Dow gaining more than three quarters of a percent, the S&P 500 climbing seven-tenths of a percent and the Nasdaq adding half a percent. One question is how much pushback there will be in Congress over whether fiscal principles are being sacrificed, said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, adding that a bill that shows profligate spending could be a disincentive to add exposure to long-dated Treasuries. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates the bill could add roughly $3.3 trillion to the country's debt by 2034 or around $5.2 trillion if policymakers extend temporary provisions. Moody's said on Friday successive administrations have failed to reverse the trend of higher fiscal deficits and interest costs, and it did not believe that material reductions in deficits will result from fiscal proposals under consideration. Concern shows up in market pricing. A recent increase in the 10-year Treasury term premium - a measure of the return investors demand for the risk of holding long-dated debt - is partly a sign of underlying fiscal worry in the market, said Anthony Woodside, head of fixed income strategy at Legal & General Investment Management America. Woodside said the market was ""not assigning much credibility"" to the deficit being brought down in a material way. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration is focused on containing benchmark 10-year yields. The yield, last seen at 4.44 percent, is about 17 basis points below where it was before Trump took office in January. ""Certainly you could see a reaction in yields to a pretty substantial increase in the deficit at a time when we're already running pretty significant deficits,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist with Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. A White House spokesperson dismissed concerns around the bill. ""The experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,"" said Harrison Fields, special assistant to the President and principal deputy press secretary, in a statement. The White House characterized the Moody's downgrade as political. White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to the move via a social media post on Friday, singling out Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, and calling him a political opponent of Trump. Zandi, who is chief economist at Moody's Analytics, a separate entity from the ratings agency, declined to comment. Some in the market believe the fiscal outlook will improve with the tax package compared to earlier expectations, due to tariff revenues and spending offsets. Barclays now estimates the cost of the bill to increase deficits by $2 trillion over the next 10 years compared to expectations of around $3.8 trillion before Trump took office. Urgency is mounting as key deadlines approach. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that he wants his chamber to pass the bill before the US Memorial Day holiday on May 26, while Bessent has urged lawmakers to raise the federal government's debt limit by mid-July. The US government reached its statutory borrowing limit in January and began employing ""extraordinary measures"" to keep it from breaching the cap. Bessent has indicated the government could hit the so-called X-date - when it runs out of cash to meet all its obligations - by August. Investor nervousness around the debt limit has started to show up. The average yield on Treasury bills due in August is higher than the yield of bills with adjacent maturities. The chart shows that the average yield on Treasury bills due in August, when the US government could run out of funds to cover all its obligations, is higher than yields on T-bills with adjacent maturities. The chart shows that the average yield on Treasury bills due in August, when the US government could run out of funds to cover all its obligations, is higher than yields on T-bills with adjacent maturities. While there is broad agreement within the Republican Party to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, there is a divide on how to achieve spending cuts that would help offset revenue loss. The room for manoeuvre on spending cuts is limited. Mandatory spending, including on social welfare programs that Trump has pledged not to touch, accounted for a vast majority of total budgetary spending last year. A politically viable fiscal package will likely lead to wider deficits in the near term, and at the same time it won't provide a meaningful fiscal boost to the economy, said Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a note published last week. Anne Walsh, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners Investment Management said that without a real process in Washington aimed at significantly resetting spending levels, a meaningful improvement in the US fiscal path is unlikely. ""This is an unsustainable course that we're on,"" she said.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:54 AM"

The commerce ministry's findings conclude a probe launched in May 2024, shortly after the US sharply increased tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, computer chips and other imports. POM copolymers can partially replace metals such as copper and zinc and have various applications including in auto parts, electronics and medical equipment, the ministry has said. In January the ministry said initial investigations had determined that dumping was taking place, and implemented preliminary anti-dumping measures in the form of a deposit starting from January 24. According to Sunday's announcement, the highest anti-dumping rates of 74.9 percent were levied on imports from the United States, while European shipments will face 34.5 percent duties. China slapped 35.5 percent duties on Japanese imports, except for Asahi Kasei Corp, which received a company-specific rate of 24.5 percent. General duties of 32.6 percent were placed on imports from Taiwan, while Formosa Plastics received a 4 percent tariff and Polyplastics Taiwan 3.8 percent. Hopes have risen that the US-China trade war is easing after the two sides said on Monday they had agreed to slash reciprocal tariffs in a 90-day truce, a deal that state mouthpiece the Global Times said on Friday should be extended. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group of nations warned of ""fundamental challenges"" facing the global trading system in a communique on Friday after a meeting in South Korea.","Sun May 18, 2025 02:31 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 02:34 PM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/moodys-downgrade-intensifies-investor-worry-about-us-fiscal-path-3897341","Moody's downgrade intensifies investor worry about US fiscal path","A US sovereign downgrade by Moody's has exacerbated investor worries about a looming debt time-bomb that could spur bond market vigilantes who want to see more fiscal restraint from Washington. The ratings agency cut America's pristine sovereign credit rating by one notch on Friday, the last of the major ratings agencies to downgrade the country, citing concerns about the nation's growing $36 trillion debt pile. The move came as Republicans who control the House of Representatives and the Senate seek to approve a sweeping package of tax cuts, spending hikes and safety-net reductions, which could add trillions to the US debt pile. Uncertainty over the final shape of the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" has investors on edge even as optimism has emerged over trade. The bill failed to clear a key hurdle on Friday even as US President Donald Trump called for unity around the legislation. ""The bond market has been keeping a sharp eye on what transpires in Washington this year in particular,"" said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, who said that Moody's downgrade may make investors more cautious. ""As Congress debates the 'big, beautiful bill' the bond vigilantes will be keeping a sharp eye on making them toe a fiscally responsible line,"" she said, referring to bond investors who punish bad policy by making it prohibitively expensive for governments to borrow. The downgrade from Moody's, which follows similar moves from Fitch in 2023 and Standard & Poor's in 2011, will ""eventually lead to higher borrowing costs for the public and private sector in the United States,"" said Spencer Hakimian, founder of Tolou Capital Management in New York. Even so, the ratings cut was unlikely to trigger forced selling from funds that can only invest in top-rated securities, said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US rates strategy at TD Securities, as most funds revised guidelines after the S&P downgrade. ""But we expect it to refocus the market's attention on fiscal policy and the bill currently being negotiated in Congress,"" Goldberg said. US stocks closed higher on Friday, with the Dow gaining more than three quarters of a percent, the S&P 500 climbing seven-tenths of a percent and the Nasdaq adding half a percent. One question is how much pushback there will be in Congress over whether fiscal principles are being sacrificed, said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman, adding that a bill that shows profligate spending could be a disincentive to add exposure to long-dated Treasuries. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates, the bill could add roughly $3.3 trillion to the country's debt by 2034 or around $5.2 trillion if policymakers extend temporary provisions. Moody's said on Friday successive administrations have failed to reverse the trend of higher fiscal deficits and interest costs, and it did not believe that material reductions in deficits will result from fiscal proposals under consideration. Concern shows up in market pricing. A recent increase in the 10-year Treasury term premium - a measure of the return investors demand for the risk of holding long-dated debt - is partly a sign of underlying fiscal worry in the market, said Anthony Woodside, head of fixed income strategy at Legal & General Investment Management America. Woodside said the market was ""not assigning much credibility"" to the deficit being brought down in a material way. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration is focused on containing benchmark 10-year yields. The yield, last seen at 4.44 percent, is about 17 basis points below where it was before Trump took office in January. ""Certainly you could see a reaction in yields to a pretty substantial increase in the deficit at a time when we're already running pretty significant deficits,"" said Garrett Melson, portfolio strategist with Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. A White House spokesperson dismissed concerns around the bill. ""The experts are wrong, just as they were about the impact of Trump's tariffs, which have yielded trillions in investments, record job growth, and no inflation,"" said Harrison Fields, special assistant to the President and principal deputy press secretary, in a statement. The White House characterized the Moody's downgrade as political. White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to the move via a social media post on Friday, singling out Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, and calling him a political opponent of Trump. Zandi, who is chief economist at Moody's Analytics, a separate entity from the ratings agency, declined to comment. Some in the market believe the fiscal outlook will improve with the tax package compared to earlier expectations, due to tariff revenues and spending offsets. Barclays now estimates the cost of the bill to increase deficits by $2 trillion over the next 10 years compared to expectations of around $3.8 trillion before Trump took office. Urgency is mounting as key deadlines approach. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said that he wants his chamber to pass the bill before the US Memorial Day holiday on May 26, while Bessent has urged lawmakers to raise the federal government's debt limit by mid-July. The US government reached its statutory borrowing limit in January and began employing ""extraordinary measures"" to keep it from breaching the cap. Bessent has indicated the government could hit the so-called X-date - when it runs out of cash to meet all its obligations - by August. Investor nervousness around the debt limit has started to show up. The average yield on Treasury bills due in August is higher than the yield of bills with adjacent maturities. While there is broad agreement within the Republican Party to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, there is a divide on how to achieve spending cuts that would help offset revenue loss. The room for manoeuvre on spending cuts is limited. Mandatory spending, including on social welfare programs that Trump has pledged not to touch, accounted for a vast majority of total budgetary spending last year. A politically viable fiscal package will likely lead to wider deficits in the near term, and at the same time it won't provide a meaningful fiscal boost to the economy, said Michael Zezas, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, in a note published last week. Anne Walsh, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners Investment Management said that without a real process in Washington aimed at significantly resetting spending levels, a meaningful improvement in the US fiscal path is unlikely. ""This is an unsustainable course that we're on,"" she said.","Sun May 18, 2025 01:29 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 01:34 PM"

""In the current circumstances, we must diversify our exports to meet this challenge and, at the same time, move toward value addition,"" he said at a discussion yesterday. The International Business Forum of Bangladesh (IBFB) organised the discussion, styled ""Revamping USA-Bangladesh Trade"", at the IBFB office in the capital. Recently, US President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs and later suspended them for three months. ""International circumstances have changed, and we must build self-confidence while focusing on diversifying our export markets,"" Chowdhury said. The government plans to establish a specialised trade negotiation body ahead of Bangladesh's graduation from least-developed country (LDC) status, he added. M Humayun Kabir, former ambassador and vice-president of the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, said there is a trust deficit in the United States toward Bangladesh when it comes to negotiations on such trade matters. ""We must work on how to build and sustain that trust,"" he said. Zaidi Sattar, chairman of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh, in his keynote presentation, highlighted the importance of engaging with the USA to negotiate tariff reductions on key export items such as agricultural products and machinery. He recommended focusing on low-revenue items and reducing tariffs on non-garment goods to help curb anti-export bias. Bangladesh could benefit from trade diversification, particularly considering China's growing tariff burden, he said, adding that collaboration with international buyers is needed to share increased costs, stressing that Bangladesh's limited bargaining power makes flexible pricing arrangements essential. Prof Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said Bangladesh needs to strengthen its trade negotiation capacity. He said signing a free trade agreement or preferential trade agreement with the United States is possible, but Bangladesh is still not ready for that. Rahman also said that although US tariffs are described as reciprocal, in reality, they are irrational and one-sided. He highlighted the importance of raising the tariff issue within the TICFA (Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum Agreement) platform but acknowledged that Bangladesh is not yet adequately prepared for such discussions. Syed Ershad Ahmed, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh, said there are not only tariff barriers in Bangladesh but many non‑tariff barriers as well. For example, he said that clearing imported goods from the customs department requires 17 signatures and takes 7 to 8 days. ""Although it takes a long time to clear cargo here, in Vietnam it takes less than a day. As a result, we're losing out in competition. In this situation, modernising the customs department is very essential,"" he said. Lutfunnisa Saudia Khan, president of the IBFB, said the suspension of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) benefits, along with the rise of protectionist trade policies in recent years, has affected Bangladesh's competitiveness in vital sectors such as garments, leather, and light manufacturing. The suspension of GSP has slowed export growth, hindered job creation, and dampened investor confidence.","Sat May 17, 2025 09:05 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 09:09 PM"

The Vietnamese trade ministry said in a statement released on Saturday that the meeting, which occurred in Jeju, South Korea, following the 31st APEC Ministerial Meeting on Trade, symbolised both nations' commitment to fostering a stable economic, trade, and investment relationship. The talks follow a phone call last month between Vietnamese trade minister Nguyen Hong Dien and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that officially started negotiations. ""USTR Greer agreed with Vietnam's current approach and proposal,"" the trade ministry's statement said. ""The United States hopes that with the mutual efforts, the technical-level negotiations in the coming days will yield positive results."" The US has postponed the implementation of the 46 percent tariff on Vietnam until July. If enforced, the levy could disrupt growth in Vietnam, which is heavily dependent on sales to the United States, its largest export market, and substantial foreign investments in manufacturing goods for export. Vietnam has the fourth-largest trade surplus among all US trading partners, worth $123.5 billion last year. In an attempt to diminish that trade surplus, Hanoi has recently implemented several measures, including reducing tariffs on a multitude of goods destined for the US and intensifying its efforts to curb the shipment of Chinese goods to the US via its territory.","Sat May 17, 2025 11:46 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 11:49 AM"

The downgrade to Aa1 from Aaa adds to the bad news for the US president, coming on the same day his flagship spending bill failed to pass a key vote in Congress due to opposition from several Republican fiscal hawks. Explaining its decision, the ratings agency noted ""the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns."" Moody's warned it expects federal deficits to widen to almost nine percent of economic output by 2035, up from 6.4 percent last year, ""driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation."" As a result, it expects the federal debt burden to increase to about 134 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, compared to 98 percent last year. The White House took to X to push back, with communications director Steven Cheung singling out the chief economist of Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, for criticism. ""Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,"" Cheung posted. - 'Fiscal house is not in order' - Moody's decision to downgrade the United States from its top credit rating mirrors similar decisions from the two other major US ratings agencies, S&P and Fitch. S&P was the first to cut its rating for the United States back in 2011, during Barack Obama's first term in office, citing its concerns that a debt management plan ""would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics."" Twelve years later, Fitch followed suit, warning of ""a steady deterioration in standards of governance over the last 20 years, including on fiscal and debt matters."" Moody's echoed its peers in its decision Friday, noting in a statement that ""successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs."" ""We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration,"" it added, flagging that it expected larger deficits to continue over the next decade. America's ""fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns,"" Moody's said. For Republican congressman French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, the Moody's downgrade ""is a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order."" House Republicans ""are committed to taking steps to restore fiscal stability, address the structural drivers of our debt, and foster a pro-growth economic environment,"" he said. Brendan Boyle, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the downgrade ""is a direct warning: our fiscal outlook is deteriorating, and House Republicans are determined to make it worse."" ""The question is whether Republicans are ready to wake up to the damage they're causing,"" Boyle said. The Moody's decision comes amid a tough fight in Congress to pass Trump's much-touted ""big, beautiful"" spending bill, which aims to revamp and renew a roughly $5 trillion extension of his 2017 tax relief, paid for at least partially through deep cuts to the Medicaid health insurance program that covers more than 70 million low-income people. On Friday, the agency also changed its outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable,"" noting that despite the United States' poor record tackling rising government debt levels, the country ""retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the role of the US dollar as global reserve currency.""","Sat May 17, 2025 08:55 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 08:58 AM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/bangladesh-overcomes-the-fear-floating-3895801","Analysis / Bangladesh overcomes the fear of floating","Bangladesh's long-delayed $1.3 billion IMF loan disbursement is now back on track, after the central bank cleared a major policy hurdle: moving towards a market-based exchange rate. The reform, long resisted due to fears of destabilisation, marks an important turning point in the country's macroeconomic management and sends a strong signal to domestic and international investors. The International Monetary Fund had paused the fourth and fifth tranches of its $4.7 billion programme over concerns that Bangladesh was lagging behind on two structural benchmarks: reforming its antiquated tax administration and making its foreign exchange regime more flexible. In May, the government delivered on both counts, dissolving the National Board of Revenue and replacing it with two modernised wings under the finance ministry, and formally permitting banks to trade dollars based on market demand and supply. While the IMF's executive board must still approve the review, the $1.3 billion release is expected in June. More importantly, the market has already responded. Commercial banks — long constrained by central directives and narrow trading bands — welcomed the policy shift, which allows them to operate more freely in the interbank forex market. This is not just about accessing IMF cash. Bangladesh needed the deal to restore credibility. The reforms unlock not only multilateral funds but also a broader confidence premium. Ratings agencies like Moody's and development partners such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank are now more likely to work constructively with Bangladesh, easing the external financing squeeze. ""By tethering less to fixed policies and more to macroeconomic realities, the switch aligns with international practices, providing an avenue for greater integration into the global financial system,"" said Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office. Lessons from Sri Lanka
 Bangladesh's cautious approach contrasts with Sri Lanka's more abrupt currency liberalisation in 2022. Faced with depleted reserves and a collapsing economy, Colombo allowed its rupee to float freely, leading to a sharp devaluation from 200 to over 360 against the dollar before eventually stabilising near 299. The painful move was essential to eliminate distortions in the forex market and restore foreign investor interest. Combined with reforms in taxation, debt restructuring, and central bank independence, Sri Lanka's currency move helped pull it back from the brink of bankruptcy. The central bank here has made it clear that it would still intervene in the currency market ""to prevent disorderly conditions."" This is a hybrid approach: the exchange rate is no longer rigidly fixed or artificially controlled, but nor is it fully subject to the whims of daily market movements. By retaining the option to intervene, the authorities aim to smooth excessive volatility and shield import-dependent sectors from sudden inflationary pressures. Still, letting go of the fear of floating comes with risks. Without proper oversight, the shift could create new scope for speculative behaviour, especially in a low-transparency environment. Experts warn that Bangladesh Bank must now strengthen market surveillance and ensure rogue traders do not game the system through artificial dollar scarcity or price collusion. ""Every exchange rate regime must strike a balance between rate flexibility and pressure on foreign exchange reserves. A flexible system reduces the burden on reserves by allowing the exchange rate to adjust naturally in response to supply or demand fluctuations. However, if such fluctuations lead to excessive volatility, the need for intervention using official reserves increases,"" Hussain said. To counter this, the central bank plans to deploy a $500 million stabilisation fund to manage sudden foreign currency shortages. If implemented effectively, the strategy could help preserve the integrity of the new regime without reverting to rigid controls. The test of the new regime will come in moments of stress — whether the central bank can resist the temptation to override market signals, or whether it falls back into administrative fixes. What's clear is that Bangladesh has taken a meaningful step in the right direction. By embracing exchange rate flexibility and pairing it with overdue institutional reforms, it has sent a message that the country is serious about correction.","Fri May 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 02:42 PM"

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/food-prices-stubbornly-high-despite-govt-measures-3753386","Food prices stubbornly high despite govt measures","When prices of widely consumed staples like potatoes, edible oil, sugar or onions spike and remain inflated for extended periods, it understandably hits the poor and low-income people where it hurts the most: in their wallet. This pain only intensifies if countermeasures, such as monetary tightening and import duty cuts, fail to curb price spirals. This is the current reality for those with limited incomes, as government data shows recent surges in the prices of essentials. The consequences could be alarming. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, published by international agencies including the United Nations (UN) in early November, says that nearly 23.3 million people, or 26 percent of Bangladesh's population, are experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity. Both the report and local businesses blame a combination of internal and external factors for runaway prices. Flood damage to crops is among internal factors while supply chain disruptions and market syndication -- kitchen market ills the interim government inherited -- continue to fuel price spirals. Kawsar Hossain, a grocer at the Mirpur-1 kitchen market in the capital, said prices of many daily essentials have increased over the past two or three months, forcing people to tighten their belts. ""Customers who used to buy 3 dozen eggs now buy 1 or 1.5 dozen. Those who used to buy 5 kg of flour are now purchasing 2-3 kg,"" Hossain said. Data from the state-run Trading Corporation (TCB) yesterday showed prices of medium rice, non-brand loose soybean oil, palm oil, potatoes, onions, garlic and cardamom have increased in the past week. The Department of Agricultural Marketing, which publishes daily retail prices of 54 commodities on its website, showed yesterday that prices of 28 commodities have increased and 13 have decreased over the past year. Tanin Hossain, a private employee who was shopping at the Mirpur kitchen market, said: ""Prices of many daily necessities are still very high. I think the government needs to do more in this area. ""If people do not feel relieved, it does not matter how many price cooling measures you have taken,"" he commented. Govt resorts to more tightening, tax cuts On October 22, the Bangladesh Bank hiked the policy or repo rate by another 50 basis points to 10 percent in its efforts to rein in inflation. That was the 11th time since May 2022 that the central bank hiked the repo rate, which makes money more expensive for banks, to tame demand and curb inflation. Meanwhile, the interim government has cut import duties on several items in the past three months to bolster supplies in its battle against inflation. The tariff cut list includes potatoes, sugar, edible oil, rice and onions. However, even amid the tightening and cuts, inflation in October hit a three-month high of 10.87 percent thanks to soaring food prices, especially for rice and vegetables. In October, food inflation hit 12.66 percent while non-food inflation declined 16 percentage points to 9.34 percent, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. To monitor the market and review the supply chain of essential commodities, the Ministry of Commerce formed a 10-member special task force at the district level. Besides, authorities are selling food items at subsidised prices through its open market sales programme inDhaka and Chattogram. Global market also heating up The prices of some commodities, including edible oil, palm oil, sugar and wheat, have recently increased on the global market. According to World Bank data, palm oil prices rose by $94 per tonne in October compared to September. During the same period, soybean oil prices rose by $51 per tonne, wheat prices by $13 per tonne and sugar by $4 per tonne. Taslim Shahriar, senior assistant general manager at Meghna Group of Industries, one of the biggest local commodity importers and processors, told The Daily Star: ""Due to the reduction of duties, the price of sugar in the local market has come down slightly and will decrease further."" He added that the price of edible oil had been increasing at an abnormal rate on the international market for the past one and a half months. ""Due to this, the government reduced the import duty, but the price of soybean and palm oil may remain high in the country's market,"" Shahriar said. He mentioned that global wheat prices also jumped, but prices had decreased a bit recently. Import flows have also increased. Market mechanism shows inefficiency Analysing the market trend of broiler chicken, beef and chilis, a trade body recently pointed the finger at inefficient market mechanisms for price hikes of kitchen essentials. Besides, the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) in October blamed high production and transportation costs, limited bargaining power due to market structure inefficiency, seasonal supply, price fluctuations and limited market access for producers as triggers for food inflation. The DCCI study recommended strengthening the supply chain by reducing intermediaries and importing essential food items that are in short supply due to imbalances between production and demand. It also suggested implementing a tracking system for cash memos of local and imported food items and providing subsidies for key agricultural inputs like fertiliser, oil and electricity to lower production costs. Selim Raihan, a professor of economics at the University of Dhaka, said the effectiveness of any initiative depends on its results. While the interim government has taken several steps regarding price control, in terms of results, there has been no major impact yet. ""You may have to wait a little longer,"" he said. According to Raihan, persistent price pressures have reached such a stage that ministries and departments need coordinated efforts to cool the market. He also mentioned that there is an information gap in the production, demand and supply of goods. Raihan said there is a limit to raising interest rates as it is already hurting the economy in a different way. ""Investment and employment generation are being hampered. The government should also keep an eye on that.""","Fri Nov 15, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sat Nov 16, 2024 08:31 PM"

Xiaomi, which sells goods from smartphones to vacuum cleaners and EVs, is one of China's most prominent consumer electronics firms. Writing on social media platform WeChat to mark the 15th year since the company's establishment, Lei Jun said: ""chips are the underlying core track for Xiaomi to break through in cutting-edge technology, so we will definitely make an all-out effort"". In pursuit of Xiaomi's semiconductor ambitions, the firm has developed an investment plan involving ""at least 10 years of investment and at least 50 billion yuan"", Lei added. Xiaomi took initial steps into semiconductors for smartphones with the launch of the firm's first in-house chip -- the Surge S1 -- in 2017. But the group was forced to halt production of the chip due to technical and financial obstacles, and has since refocused on other components as well as a move into the electric vehicle sector. ""That is not our 'dark history'. That is the path we have travelled,"" wrote Lei on Monday. Since 2021, Xiaomi's chip development program has already received 13.5 billion yuan in research and development funds for a team of more than 2,500 employees, said the billionaire entrepreneur. The announcement comes in the face of heightened technological tensions between Beijing and Washington as both nations seek to ensure access to the most advanced components. A number of Chinese firms are racing to develop their own chips with the aim of freeing themselves from reliance on foreign suppliers in the face of that rivalry. ""Xiaomi has always had a 'chip dream',"" Lei wrote, adding: ""I earnestly request everyone to give us more time and patience to support our continued exploration on this road"".","Mon May 19, 2025 12:56 PM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 01:00 PM"

""We're not seeing the kind of structural transformation or reduction in anti-equity bias that would signal a meaningful shift in economic management,"" he said. He made the remarks at an event titled ""Bangladesh Economy 2025-26: Policy Reform and National Budget"", organised by the Citizens' Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, held at the Lakeshore Hotel in Dhaka. He said that the government has paid little attention to economic reforms compared to other types of reform. ""If there is no stability in the economy, no other reform will be sustainable,"" he said. Bhattacharya also pointed out that the upcoming budget for FY26 would be shaped by three key deficits: a lack of cooperation and inclusivity, poor coordination, and limited transparency. ""There has been minimal public engagement in the budget-making process. We saw no real dialogue outside Dhaka, nor substantial inclusion of diverse groups even within the capital,"" he said. On the issue of separating tax policy from administration, Bhattacharya said the reform initiatives should involve broader consultations with multiple stakeholders and be carried out transparently. ""The decision to divide it into two divisions is the right one, and it was also one of the recommendations in our white paper,"" he said. ""However, the way it has been implemented is not appropriate. It was done without proper consultation, by shrinking the space for professionals and increasing control over other administrative areas."" ""This approach is flawed, and implementing the reform properly has now become a matter of significant importance.""

The move dealt a blow to markets, which had enjoyed a healthy run-up last week after Washington and China hammered out a deal to temporarily slash tit-for-tat tariffs, dialling down the tensions in a painful trade war between the superpowers. After the rout sparked by US President Donald Trump's Liberation Day tariffs bazooka, investors have in recent weeks raced back to buy up beaten-down stocks as the White House tempered its hardball tariff approach and then announced the agreement with China. But selling pressure returned Monday after Moody's cut its rating on US debt to Aa1 from Aaa, noting ""the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns"". It added that it expected federal deficits to widen to almost nine percent of economic output by 2035, up from 6.4 percent last year, ""driven mainly by increased interest payments on debt, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation"". Analysts said the cut in the gold standard rating -- which follows S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023 -- could indicate investors will want higher yields on Treasuries, pushing up the cost of government debt. Still, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed the announcement, saying it was ""a lagging indicator"" and blaming Trump's predecessor Joe Biden. ""We didn't get here in the past 100 days,"" he told CNN. ""It's the Biden administration and the spending that we have seen over the past four years that we inherited, 6.7 percent deficit-to-GDP, the highest when we weren't in a recession, not in a war."" And White House communications director Steven Cheung hit out at Moody's Analytics on X, singling out its chief economist Mark Zandi. ""Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,"" Cheung posted. The news added to a frustrating time for the US president after Congress failed to pass his ""big, beautiful bill"" to extend tax cuts passed in his first term and impose new restrictions on welfare programmes. Independent congressional analysts say the package would add more than $4.8 trillion to the federal deficit over the coming decade. The bill came up short in a key vote owing to opposition from several Republican fiscal hawks. Republican congressman French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, said the downgrade ""is a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order"". House Speaker Mike Johnson told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he plans for a floor vote on the package by the end of the week. Equities in Hong Kong and Shanghai fell as below-forecast Chinese retail sales figures reinforced the view that the world's number two economy continues to struggle even after officials unveiled fresh stimulus measures. However, factory output picked up more than expected. Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Singapore, Wellington, Taipei and Jakarta all fell, while US futures were also well down. The dollar was also down against its peers. Gold recovered some recent losses owing to its safe haven appeal, rising to $3,225 per ounce. Still, National Australia Bank's Ray Attrill said: ""Moody's actions will have zero impact on any investor's ability or willingness to continue holding US Treasuries -- that would likely require downgrades of four or five more notches."" And SPI Asset Management's Stephen Innes said investors would be more interested in upcoming data that would provide a better idea about the state of the world's top economy. ""Moody's may have dropped the mic, but for equity traders, the real test this week will be Main Street,"" he wrote in a note. ""We're heading into a make-or-break retail earnings slate -- Target, Home Depot, Lowe's, TJX, Ralph Lauren all report -- and this is where tariff theory collides with checkout-line reality. ""Yes, the S&P has clawed back 18 percent since the 'Liberation Day' tariff blitz, but the consumer has been the market's unsung hero. Now they're about to be audited.""

Their geographic closeness, economic links, and cross-border connectivity make this partnership strategically important. However, some recent policy decisions and reactions from both sides have raised serious concerns. Especially, the imposition of non-tariff barriers is creating new problems. These affect not only trade but also trust and regional stability. India has suddenly restricted certain Bangladeshi consumer goods—like fruit juice, processed foods, plastic items, and garments—through land ports in its northeast. In recent times, Bangladesh also imposed restrictions on importing Indian yarn through specific land ports. Though these are not direct tariff hikes, they work as port restrictions and certainly non-tariff barriers; they limit trade routes and make business operations harder. The withdrawal of transhipment facilities by India for Bangladesh has added more pressure. Importantly, India—including its northeast—is a valuable market for Bangladesh. There is steady demand there for Bangladeshi garments, food products, and plastics. These goods had long entered India by land without any major issues. Sudden limits now increase costs and hurt small and medium businesses near the border. Garments, a major export item for Bangladesh, may now rely on distant sea ports like Kolkata or Nhava Sheva. This raises transport costs, delays shipments, and hurts competitiveness. At the same time, Bangladesh depends on Indian yarn, a key raw material for its textile and garment industries. Any import barriers raise production costs and disrupt the local industry. Sudden, one-sided decisions harm both countries' industries and weaken the trust built over time. While each country has the right to control its trade, stability, prior notice, and reasonable coordination are essential in policymaking. Sudden trade barriers bring uncertainty for businesses and hurt the region's trade system. Long-established supply chains may break down. Such actions also risk damaging bilateral trust and cooperation. What's most needed now is a shift in mindset. These issues shouldn't be seen as rivalry or punishment. Instead, both countries should work together to find solutions. Both sides support regional unity, cross-border trade, and economic growth. So, the impact of non-tariff measures must be reviewed and reconsidered quickly. Governments, policymakers, trade bodies, and the private sector must strengthen dialogue to prevent future crises. A sustainable, inclusive, and streamlined trade framework is needed—one that reduces sudden disruptions and builds stronger business ties. Trade between Bangladesh and India is not just about their economic interests. It's vital for South Asia's unity, stability, and progress. This trade and business relationship must not weaken due to non-tariff barriers, lack of coordination, or reactive policies. The right path forward lies in dialogue, understanding, and long-term cooperation.","Mon May 19, 2025 11:29 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:51 PM"

The jobless rate stood at 3.95 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) said yesterday. In the July-September quarter of fiscal year 2024-25, the unemployment rate was 4.49 percent, as economic activity nearly came to a halt amid a mass uprising that led to the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina regime and subsequent labour unrest in major industrial areas of Dhaka.

The overall unemployment rate last year was 4.48 percent, compared to 4.15 percent in 2023.

His comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs. ""Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,"" Trump said in a social media post. ""Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING."" Walmart said it has always worked to keep its prices as low as possible, adding that this practice will not stop. ""We'll keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can given the reality of small retail margins,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise, which primarily comes from China, would not drive food prices higher. Many US companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations amid friction between the US and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending. As a bellwether of US consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low. Every week, 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90 percent of the US population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart. Walmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon  planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products.

For the first time, the planning ministry has used a digital budget planning system to categorise spending based on economic codes, allowing for more transparent tracking of fund utilisation, according to a presentation made by the planning ministry during yesterday's National Economic Council meeting. The development budget for fiscal 2025-26 was approved at the meeting chaired by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus. Under the digital budget planning method, the allocations will be tracked and implemented through the iBAS++ system, ensuring code-based expenditure. According to the planning ministry, Tk 28,018 crore will be spent only for non-residential government buildings and another Tk 9,016 crore will be spent for residential buildings under all the ministries and divisions. In addition, the segment of other buildings and establishments would cost Tk 6,917 crore. About Tk 16,073 crore would be spent on the buildings' electrification. Another Tk 15,828 crore will be spent on land acquisition for various projects. Some Tk 6,505 crore would be spent to build bridges and Tk 6,473 crore for dams. Another Tk 17,358 crore would be spent on building roads and highways, while rural roads will cost another Tk 9,021 crore. The government has allocated Tk 9,627 crore for research and development purposes. Next fiscal year's ADP is Tk 14,000 crore more than the revised allocation for this year. Of the total, Tk 144,000 crore will come from domestic resources -- lower than the Tk 1,59,000 crore sought by ministries -- while foreign funding remains unchanged at Tk 86,000 crore. Both figures reflect year-on-year declines of 12.7 percent and 14 percent respectively. State-owned enterprises have been allocated Tk 8,000 crore, nearly half of their original outlay in the current year. The government has allocated 70 percent of the ADP budget to five sectors: the transport and communication (Tk 58,973 crore), power and energy (Tk 32,392 crore), education (Tk 28,557 crore), housing and community (Tk 22,776 crore) and health (Tk 18,148 crore). Among the government's ministries and divisions, the top 10 ministries got 74 percent of the total ADP allocation in the upcoming fiscal year. The local government division got the highest allocation (Tk 36,098 crore), followed by the road transport and highways (Tk 32,329 crore), power division (Tk 20,283 crore), secondary and higher education division (Tk 13,625 crore), science and technology ministry (12,154 crore) and health service division (Tk 11,617 crore). ""It will be a budget for restoring discipline in the financial sector,"" said Planning Adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud after the meeting. Though the budget size would be relatively small, it is designed to restore economic stability, control inflation and reintroduce discipline and sustainability in budget management. ""Our objective is to avoid falling into a debt trap, where a significant portion of the budget is consumed by loan repayments -- be it operating costs or interest payments."" To break this vicious cycle, revenue must be increased, but expenditure must also remain limited. ""We aim to keep the budget deficit below 4 percent of total GDP."" Education and health have received special attention in the budget. The development budget for the two sectors would not increase, but the revenue budget would increase to accommodate teachers' higher salaries and the appointment of 2,500 new health workers, including doctors. ""In the health sector, despite many facilities being built, many are non-operational due to a lack of doctors or equipment. So instead of more infrastructure, we are focusing on operating these through the revenue budget,"" he said. The government will increase allocation so that the non-government teachers' outstanding retirement benefits and welfare payments that have been pending for the last 5–6 years can be cleared immediately. No long-term mega projects are being included in the development budget. Although this year's development budget is smaller in nominal terms than last year's proposed budget, it is more realistic, he said. ""There was a lot of waste and inefficiency. We are now streamlining, downsizing and redesigning to reduce costs."" The budget would be announced on June 2, when the tax measures of the budget become effective immediately. As there is no parliament existing now, there will be windows for tax measures' corrections until the Finance Bill is announced through ordinances.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:14 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 11:14 AM"

Trust Bank's provisions against loans and advances and other accounts stood at Tk 214.70 crore, up 7 percent from the same quarter a year ago, owing to a rise in classified loans. The bank also said that its current tax expenses increased due to higher operating profit. As of April 3, 2025, sponsor-directors held 60 percent of the bank's shares, institutional investors 22.24 percent, foreign investors 0.02 percent and general investors 17.14 percent, according to Dhaka Stock Exchange data. Trust Bank, operating since 1999, is sponsored by the Army Welfare Trust. It operates 119 branches and SME centres and eight sub-branches throughout the country, as per its website.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:09 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 04:25 AM"

The decision came from a high-level meeting of the interim government. Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur, Attorney General Md Asaduzzaman, and ICT Policy Adviser Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb were also present at the meeting held in Dhaka. ""We identified the irregularities at Nagad, and all of a sudden, a group took over the MFS provider. The government is going to take action against them,"" the finance adviser told The Daily Star. The postal department will not manage the MFS, despite being Nagad's parent entity; instead, an independent board will run the service, he added. Md Shafayet Alam, who assumed the role of CEO of Nagad, will have to step down because the takeover was illegal, according to the finance adviser. During a press briefing on Saturday, Bangladesh Bank Executive Director and spokesperson Arief Hossain Khan said that further fraudulent activities could have occurred at the mobile financial service provider. Because individuals previously implicated in fraud cases are now operating the platform, which serves a client base of around 9.5 crore, according to Khan. The High Court stayed the activities of the central bank-appointed administrator, Motasem Billah, on May 7 this year, following a petition by one of Nagad's former directors. In the absence of the administrator, former Nagad director Md Shafayet Alam assumed the role of CEO, despite facing fraud charges in a case filed by the Bangladesh Bank.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:04 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 02:05 AM"

""We have learned about the restrictions through media reports and social media,"" Bashir Uddin told reporters today at the Secretariat in Dhaka. He, however, said that the government has begun assessing the potential impact of the move based on media reports.  ""We have initiated a preliminary review to determine the steps Bangladesh should consider,"" the commerce adviser said. India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in a notification last night said Delhi has imposed new restrictions on the import of garments, agro-processed foods, and other goods from Bangladesh through land ports. According to a notification, garments—the single largest Bangladeshi export to India—will only be allowed entry through two sea ports: Kolkata and Nhava Sheva near Mumbai. The rules take immediate effect. When asked whether the decision would significantly affect Bangladesh's exports to India, Bashir Uddin said the country exports a relatively small volume of furniture to India. But clothing items account for a sizable amount of the total export. ""Our products are exported mainly due to their competitive pricing. We hope this competitiveness will continue to benefit consumers and businesses in both countries,"" he said. The latest restrictions follow Delhi's decision in April to suspend transhipment facilities for Bangladeshi cargo bound for third countries via Indian land borders, triggering concerns over tightening trade conditions. However, the adviser said, ""This is not a continuation of the transhipment issue. Indian traders will also feel the impact of this move. Given our geographical proximity, both countries remain interdependent,"" he added. ""It will take a day or two to fully understand the implications. After that, we will decide on the necessary course of action,"" he said. Bashir Uddin also reiterated Bangladesh's commitment to trade liberalisation. ""We believe in trade liberalisation and working towards greater trade inclusion. It is our responsibility to safeguard the interests of both consumers and traders,"" he said.

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/india-curbs-land-port-imports-bangladesh-3897036","India curbs land port imports from Bangladesh","India has imposed restrictions on the import of garments, agro-processed foods, furniture and other goods from Bangladesh through land ports, a move likely to disrupt trade flows and increase logistical challenges for exporters. According to a notification issued yesterday by India's Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), garments -- the single largest Bangladeshi export to India -- will only be allowed entry through two sea ports: Kolkata and Nhava Sheva near Mumbai. The rules take immediate effect.  This is essentially a non-tariff barrier to our garment exports. Now that shipments must go through sea ports, lead times will increase significantly, which in turn will raise costs for Indian importers sourcing from Bangladesh.  The notification also bars imports of fruits, carbonated and fruit-flavoured drinks, processed foods, cotton and cotton yarn waste, PVC and plastic products, and wooden furniture via land ports in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram, and the West Bengal crossings at Phulbari and Changrabandha. However, the restrictions will not apply to fish, liquefied petroleum gas, edible oils, or crushed stone. Nor will they affect Bangladesh's exports to Nepal and Bhutan transiting through Indian territory. The move follows India's earlier decision in April to suspend transhipment facilities for Bangladeshi cargo bound for third countries via Indian land borders, raising concerns about tightening trade conditions. India is one of Bangladesh's fastest-growing apparel markets, with garment exports valued at about $700 million annually. Around 93 percent of those shipments move through land ports, making the new restrictions especially disruptive. Bangladesh exported $1.55 billion worth of goods to India in fiscal 2023-24, down 9 percent year-on-year, according to data from the Export Promotion Bureau. Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury (Parvez), former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), said the restrictions will hurt Bangladesh's apparel exports. ""This is essentially a non-tariff barrier to our garment exports,"" he said. ""Now that shipments must go through sea ports, lead times will increase significantly, which in turn will raise costs for Indian importers sourcing from Bangladesh."" RN Paul, managing director of RFL Group, expressed concern over the sudden restrictions on road-based land port exports. ""We were not informed in advance that several items would no longer be exportable via Indian land ports. The list reportedly includes plastic goods and plastic granules, which we export in significant volumes,"" he said. ""These restrictions will severely disrupt our trade. These exports form a vital part of our monthly revenue,"" Paul said. ""We may have to scale up our Agartala and West Bengal operations. We already have small supply chains there, but this situation may force us to expand quickly,"" he added. Paul also said confectionery products, another major export, are included in the new restrictions. ""This is not just an RFL issue. At least 20 Bangladeshi companies would be affected,"" he said. ""We must act now. Exporters need time to adjust. We should also begin identifying alternative export corridors,"" he added, pointing to an old transit route near Bishramganj, adjacent to Agartala, as a potential option. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the move will force exporters to rely solely on sea routes. ""This decision will ultimately hurt Indian importers more than anyone else,"" he said. ""Sea shipment is time-consuming and lacks the flexibility of land port logistics. Indian buyers who depend on just-in-time delivery will face serious disruptions."" Selim H Rahman, chairman of Hatil Furniture and the Bangladesh Furniture Industries Owners Association, said the restriction could hamper bilateral trade. ""Policymakers in the Bangladeshi government must step in to address this issue,"" he said, adding that Hatil exports furniture worth $1.5 million to $2 million annually to India. Selim Raihan, executive director of the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, said such sudden and selective port restrictions can hinder the growth of bilateral and regional trade. ""While regulatory oversight is a sovereign right, such measures increase trade costs and create uncertainty, especially for small and medium-sized exporters,"" he said. He added that the northeastern region of India is a natural market for Bangladeshi goods, and limiting access undermines supply chains built over the years. ""I hope that such NTBs can be reviewed in the spirit of bilateral and regional cooperation,"" Raihan said. Constructive dialogue and better coordination on trade facilitation would help support inclusive and sustainable economic growth for both countries, he added. In a notice issued on April 13, Bangladesh's National Board of Revenue blocked yarn imports through the Benapole, Bhomra, Banglabandha, Burimari, and Sonamasjid land ports to protect the domestic textile and spinning industry from Indian raw material imports. Mohammad Abdur Razzaque, economist and chairman of the Dhaka-based think tank Research and Policy Integration for Development, said it is unfortunate that the two neighbours are now restricting, rather than facilitating, trade. ""For neighbours, land ports can be a vital mechanism for boosting trade and welfare gains,"" he said. ""Obstructing those routes stifles trade flows and raises exporters' costs."" Razzaque said that India is a critical market for both garment and non-garment Bangladeshi exports. ""Trade restrictions and retaliatory measures make both countries worse off,"" he said.","Sun May 18, 2025 02:02 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 09:50 AM"

In the budget for next fiscal year, Tk 163,103 crore would be earmarked for the ministries, which is about 70 percent of the total ADP allocation, The Daily Star has learnt from planning ministry officials involved with the proceedings. Among the top 10 ministries and divisions, eight are getting fewer allocations than this year, but two are getting more resources: the secondary and higher education division and the road transport and highway division. The railway ministry, the power division, and the primary and mass education ministry will see the biggest chop. The railway ministry's allocation would almost be halved to Tk 7,715 crore in fiscal 2025-26 as foreign funds have dried up for the sector. Of the total allocated amount, Tk 3,258 crore would be foreign funds. Most of the railway mega projects have already been completed and the projects under Indian line of credits (LOC) are progressing at a snail's pace. Besides, no mega projects would be initiated by the interim government, which resulted in major cuts in the railway ministry. The power division's allocation would be downsized 30.5 percent to Tk 20,284 crore, which is the third highest allocation in the upcoming fiscal year's ADP. Although the local government division is getting less allocation than this year, it is still getting the top share: Tk 36,099 crore. The local government is not functioning in many places but it is still getting preference as the interim government is looking to increase temporary employment in rural areas, officials said. The road transport and highway division, which has several ongoing projects, is getting the second-highest allocation: Tk 32,330 crore. This year, the division got Tk 32,043 crore. The allocation for the primary and mass education ministry will be downsized to Tk 11,399 crore from Tk 16,136 crore but the secondary and higher education division will get Tk 2,000 crore more than this fiscal year. The division is likely to get Tk 13,625 crore in fiscal 2015-26. The health services division, which spends around half of the health sector allocation, is expected to get Tk 11,618 crore -- Tk 2,000 crore less than this fiscal year. The science and technology ministry's allocation is likely to be trimmed by about 5.7 percent to Tk 12,155 crore. Of the allocation, a big portion is kept for the Rooppur nuclear power plant, whose first unit is expected to start commercial operation in the upcoming fiscal year. The total ADP for fiscal 2025-26 is likely to be Tk 230,000 crore, up 6.5 percent from this year's revised ADP. Of the total allocation, Tk 144,000 crore would come from domestic resources, down 12.7 percent year-on-year. About Tk 86,000 crore would be foreign funds, down 14 percent year-on-year. Besides, the allocation for the state-owned enterprises would be Tk 8,000 crore, which is nearly half their original allocation this fiscal year. In the first nine months of this fiscal year, ADP implementation stood at just 36.65 percent, the lowest in at least 15 years. The proposed ADP will be finalised today at the meeting of the National Economic Council. The non-development allocations would be finalised later and the budget would be announced on June 2.","Sun May 18, 2025 12:20 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 11:42 AM"

The other demands are for the public disclosure of a state advisory committee's report on reforms required for the NBR, which was submitted to the finance ministry, and inclusive, consultative and sustainable reforms for the revenue administration. The strike, led by ""NBR Reform Unity Council"", a platform of cadre and non-cadre officials, is in protest of a recently-issued ordinance for the dissolution of the NBR's existing structure. Amid the ongoing strike, revenue activities—including import and export—have been disrupted nationwide, posing a serious risk to overall revenue collection and causing significant setbacks for regular business operations. For example, customs clearance of imported consignments at Chattogram Custom House on Wednesday dropped by nearly half of that on the day before, according to data from the customs authority. On Tuesday, 3,460 import bills of entry were processed, whereas the number fell to 1,874 on Wednesday – the first day of the strike. It stood at 1,897 on Thursday. On Saturday, customs activities remained suspended until 3:00pm due to the ongoing strike, officials said. A visit to Chattogram Custom House on Saturday revealed near-complete inactivity at the customs assessment sections. Most desks were found empty, and representatives of importers were seen standing with files in hand, waiting for officers who were absent. As per regulations, no consignment can be cleared without assessment and examination by customs officials. The strike has also brought operations at the Chattogram VAT office, export processing zone customs, and the customs bond commissionerate to a halt. ""Assessment and examination activities at the custom house have remained suspended due to the pen-down strike. No official is carrying out these duties,"" said Mohammad Saidul Islam, deputy commissioner of Chattogram Custom House. However, export services and airport operations remain unaffected, he added. At a press briefing yesterday, NBR Reform Unity Council called for resolving the ongoing deadlock through discussions. They also called on Chief Adviser of the interim government Prof Muhammad Yunus to intervene and issue necessary directives. ""We are waiting for the government to initiate dialogue with us under the guidance of the chief adviser. The door for discussion has always been open on our part—and it will remain so,"" said Nipun Chakma, deputy commissioner of customs. ""We urge the government to make the NBR Reform Committee's recommendations public,"" said Md Asaduzzaman, joint commissioner of taxes. ""While we are in favour of reforms, they must be practical, reflect the views of all stakeholders, and properly value the expertise and experience of NBR officials and employees,"" he said. At the briefing, NBR Reform Unity Council sincerely apologised for the temporary inconvenience caused to taxpayers and service seekers. ""We believe that this temporary sacrifice will play an active role in serving the greater interest of the country and its people, as well as in ensuring sustainable reform of the revenue system,"" said the platform's representatives. ""Additionally, we want to make it clear that, if our demands are met, we will work beyond regular office hours to complete any pending tasks,"" they said. Based on the opinions of the general members, the unelected executive committee of the BCS Taxation Association has been declared illegal and dissolved, according to the platform. On the other hand, as almost all members of the Executive Committee of the BCS Customs and VAT Association have resigned, it has also become ineffective. In a statement, BCS Taxation Association said all activities of the organisation have been suspended indefinitely. As before, international passenger services, export activities, and preparations for the national budget will remain out of the purview of today's strike.

""A rational option could be eliminating para-tariffs, like supplementary duties and regulatory duties, which would lower effective import tariffs and signal goodwill toward US trade concerns,"" he said. Speaking at a seminar titled ""US Reciprocal Tariffs and the Way Forward for Bangladesh"", hosted by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce & Industry (DCCI) yesterday, Bhattacharya proposed strategic reforms to enhance competitiveness. He emphasised the importance of leveraging crises for reform. ""A crisis should be regarded as an opportunity,"" he said. ""Reciprocal tariffs, though intended as fair, ultimately burden end consumers and undermine competitiveness. ""There is no final enemy in trade – commerce flows where profit lies,"" he added, advocating for pragmatism in policy and diplomacy. Beyond the ready-made garment sector, Bhattacharya identified leather and pharmaceuticals as key areas with untapped export potential. He also warned of macroeconomic vulnerabilities if trade wars trigger competitive currency devaluations. Addressing concerns over the country's upcoming graduation from least developed country status, he dismissed fears of an immediate shock. ""Graduation itself won't cause a crisis. The real test lies in strategic readiness and pragmatic policymaking."" Bhattacharya also called on the government to engage more seriously in service-sector trade talks, pointing out that the US remains a vital but under-leveraged market for Bangladesh. Mahbubur Rahman, commerce secretary, said Bangladesh is committed to narrowing its trade deficit with the US by increasing imports of goods and services from the world's largest economy. ""Following the US tariff imposition, we have responded quickly and responsibly."" On facilitating cotton imports from the US, Rahman said a warehouse could be established in Bangladesh to streamline delivery. He also highlighted a long-term LNG import deal with the US that is expected to boost bilateral trade by nearly $1 billion. ""Imports of US-origin goods via third countries should be recognised as direct imports in trade discussions,"" he added. Mahbubur Rahman, president of the International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh (ICCB), urged the government to continue negotiations and criticised the US for unilaterally imposing tariffs. ""This contradicts WTO norms."" He also expressed concern over weak public-private dialogue and suggested diversifying exports beyond traditional markets by focusing on Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Abul Kasem Khan, chairperson of Business Initiative Leading Development (BUILD), called for exploring a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US. ""Policy support is essential for export diversification,"" he said, also urging the formulation of a strategic roadmap for tapping new markets. Md Mezbaul Haque, executive director of the Bangladesh Bank, said the recent US tariffs could spark a price war, forcing local industries to increase efficiency. ""Our competitiveness is already under pressure due to high financing and energy costs,"" he said. To support exporters, the central bank is offering Export Facilitation (EF) funds at a subsidised 5 percent interest rate, Haque added. M Masrur Reaz, chairman and CEO of the Policy Exchange Bangladesh, termed the US tariff action ""more political than commercial"". He criticised the government's limited response beyond a formal letter and urged a more informed, strategic approach. ""Our import demand for US-origin cotton, soybean, and LNG is growing — these must be included in bilateral talks,"" he said. Reaz also underlined the need to improve logistics, noting that Bangladesh's costs are significantly higher than those of regional peers. Shams Mahmud, a former DCCI president, cautioned that higher US tariffs could reduce demand for Bangladeshi products, intensifying competition for export orders. He reiterated the need to count US-origin goods imported via third countries as direct imports during trade negotiations. Mahmud also called for urgent improvement in the business environment, particularly in ensuring uninterrupted power supply to industrial zones. Razeeb Haider, director of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, said textile production has dropped nearly 45 percent due to declining gas pressure in factories. He added that while US cotton is of premium quality, it is costly and takes over three months to arrive, which deters importers. ""If the US establishes warehouse facilities here, our cotton imports could increase fourfold,"" Haider suggested. Taskeen Ahmed, president of the DCCI, described Bangladesh as standing at a ""critical crossroads"" shaped by shifting global trade dynamics. He called for urgent reforms, including trade facilitation improvements, exploring FTAs, boosting digital competitiveness, and enhancing skills development. ""To navigate this uncertain landscape, we need immediate and long-term actions,"" Ahmed said. ""Most importantly, a well-coordinated public-private partnership is essential to tackle tariff challenges without delay.""","Sun May 18, 2025 12:16 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 11:15 AM"

Yet, they continue to pressure factories to cut prices further. A shirt manufactured in Bangladesh at a free-on-board (FoB) price of $5 often retails for as much as $28 in Europe or North America. Once shipping, warehousing, duties, and other operational costs are added, bringing the total to around $16, retailers may still earn a profit of about $12 per item. Western retailers and brands often justify their pricing strategies by pointing to the high costs associated with global operations, including freight charges, currency hedging, warehousing, demurrage, markdowns, and advertising. ""There are overheads, of course, but let's not pretend they're not making money,"" said Fazle Shamim Ehsan, proprietor of Fatullah Apparels. ""Especially in the mid to high-end market, many brands earn huge profits from goods made in Bangladesh."" Still, many Western buyers continue to pressure Bangladeshi factories to reduce the prices further. A 2020 study by the European non-profit Fair Wear Foundation found that nearly 39 percent of garment manufacturers in the country had sold products at a loss. The practice, exporters say, is mainly to preserve long-standing relationships with global retailers and to secure future contracts. Meanwhile, data from the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a Dhaka-based think tank, suggests that Bangladesh consistently receives lower prices than its Asian competitors for similar products. In 2020, Bangladeshi cotton T-shirts exported to the European Union (EU) fetched €1,091.5 per 100 kilogrammes, a 1 percent decline from the previous year, while Vietnam's equivalent product saw a 3 percent price increase, rising to €2,157.9. The contrast was even sharper in pullovers. Bangladesh's average price fell 7 percent to €1,329.5, whereas Vietnamese pullovers held steady at €2,157.8. For garments made from man-made fibres, Bangladeshi exports declined 6 percent to €1,319.4, while Vietnam's fell by just 3 percent to €1,906.2. The United States market reflected similar patterns, as shown in the CPD data. The average price for a dozen Bangladeshi-made cotton T-shirts dropped from $22.43 in 2019 to $17.99 in 2020, a 20 percent fall, while Vietnamese suppliers experienced a slightly smaller decline, with prices falling from $38.2 to $31.9. Bangladeshi sweaters and pullovers also saw a 2 percent price drop to $39.31 per dozen, whereas Vietnamese equivalents remained largely unchanged, with prices hovering around $47. For trousers, the gap was wider still. A dozen cotton-fibre trousers for women and girls exported from Bangladesh earned $64.17 in 2020, down 12 percent from the year before. Vietnam, by comparison, received $84.6 for the same product after a smaller price adjustment of just 6 percent. SYSTEMIC UNDERVALUATION A 2022 report by the International Trade Centre (ITC) underscored the pattern of systemic undervaluation of Bangladeshi garments. Men's woven cotton trousers exported from Bangladesh earned an FoB price of $7.01 per piece, which was 9.2 percent below the global average of $7.72. Vietnam received $10.76 for the same item, while Sri Lanka and India fetched $8 and $8.41. Similarly, men's cotton jeans made in Bangladesh were sold at $7.81 per piece, 7.2 percent below the global average of $8.41, while Vietnamese jeans sold for $11.55. Even in niche categories like man-made fibre bras, Bangladesh was paid considerably less, with exporters earning $3.19 per unit compared to Vietnam's $6.06. Only two Bangladeshi products -- women's cotton trousers and men's cotton T-shirts -- were sold at slightly above the global average. Women's cotton trousers earned $6.43 apiece, exceeding the world average of $5.22 by 23.3 percent, while men's T-shirts fetched $1.47, roughly 23.1 percent higher than the global benchmark. Still, these figures were dwarfed by the earnings of countries like Turkey and Peru, which received up to four times more for similar items. According to the ITC, which has a joint mandate with the World Trade Organization and the United Nations, these pricing gaps represent an entrenched imbalance in the global supply chain. Industry insiders say Bangladesh's quality has improved, but its bargaining power remains weak. RETAILERS CITE HIGH OPERATIONAL COSTS Ehsan, owner of Fatullah Apparels, said jackets and outerwear produced in Bangladesh, often sold to retailers at FoB prices ranging from $20 to $25, regularly appear in stores for $100 to $110. He added that some of the world's richest individuals have built their fortunes in fashion retail, with Bangladesh as a key production hub. The profit chain often stretches beyond the retailers themselves. Md Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Plummy Fashions Ltd, pointed out that a significant share of Bangladesh's garment exports is managed by intermediaries or third-party importers, who also take a cut before the goods reach retail shelves. ""Sometimes we sell a T-shirt at $3.50, and it ends up in a branded store for $39,"" Hoque said. ""Of course, it doesn't stay at that price forever -- discounting comes in later, but the markup is still substantial."" He added that while pricing can vary across seasons and product categories, the general rule of thumb remains: most garments are sold at three to four times their FoB value. However, a European retailer, on condition of anonymity, disputed the claims of excessive markups. ""Those suggesting a substantial markup on Bangladeshi garment items are gravely mistaken,"" he said. ""In the garment supply chain, a European retailer must rent large warehouses to store goods, which is quite costly,"" he said, adding that transportation expenses also factor in. ""Renting retail space is another major expense, and ultimately, retailers and brands can sell, at best, 70 percent of the goods from a single consignment,"" he said. ""Once the season ends, unsold items can no longer be offered to customers."" The retailer said that European companies pay higher wages than their Asian counterparts, which also affects profit margins. ""Ultimately, European retailers earn less than 10 percent profit annually. The claims of high markups are exaggerated."" CALL FOR FAIR PRICING Apparel industry advocates and multilateral organisations are increasingly urging retailers to adopt more equitable pricing models. The ITC noted in its report that while apparel manufacturing has grown more complex, involving design, logistics, and branding, the actual cut-and-sew operations, which remain concentrated in countries like Bangladesh, continue to be the least rewarded. Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at CPD, said that China and Vietnam are getting higher prices for their garments by utilising diverse fabrics and innovative product designs, despite sharing the same HS codes as Bangladesh. In contrast, Bangladesh's garment exports are heavily reliant on just five or six products, accounting for 70 percent of its total exports. This concentration creates unhealthy competition, tempting local exporters to undercut prices, said Moazzem. He also pointed out that the industry's heavy dependence on cotton and limited use of man-made fibres are also obstructing better prices. ""Bringing in more foreign investment could be a viable solution, as foreign investors usually have access to upmarket buyers and advanced technologies,"" said the CPD research director.","Sun May 18, 2025 12:15 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 12:40 PM"

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/yunus-bank-dedicated-microcredit-3896641","Yunus for a bank dedicated to microcredit","Chief Adviser Prof Muhammad Yunus yesterday proposed the establishment of a dedicated microcredit bank based on the social business model. While inaugurating the Microcredit Regulatory Authority (MRA) building in the capital's Agargaon, he said the proposed bank would not be a conventional one. ""A new perspective is needed here [microfinance sector], and that is establishing a microcredit bank,"" said Yunus, who pioneered the concept of microcredit and microfinance. Yunus and Grameen Bank, which he founded, were jointly awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2006 for their efforts to ""create economic and social development from below"". Grameen Bank's objective has been to provide small loans to the poor without requiring collateral -- a system known as microcredit. The chief adviser noted that microfinance organisations currently operate under an NGO-style framework. ""If they want to transition out of the NGO-style stage, they must evolve into a full-fledged bank."" He added that a separate law should be enacted for the proposed microcredit bank. ""This must be a new kind of bank. The Microcredit Regulatory Authority or any other organisation can serve as its regulatory body."" He said that when such a licence is granted, it must clearly state that it is not for conventional banking operations, adding that it will function as a social business entity to ensure that owners cannot extract profits. Yunus said the proposed bank would also provide young people with loans in the form of venture capital, allowing them to invest in their businesses and become entrepreneurs. ""If the young people get capital for their business from the bank, they will never [have to] run around for a job."" Citing Grameen Bank as an example, he said that microcredit recipients would be the owners of the proposed bank. Reflecting on Grameen Bank's evolution as a microcredit institution, he described the microcredit system as the ""real banking system"", contrasting it with conventional banks that disburse loans against guarantees. ""Grameen Bank extends credit to the poor based on trust."" The remarks come at a time when, ironically, collateral-based banks -- the so-called ""real banks"" -- have vanished into thin air. ""They are nowhere to be found, their funds have disappeared, and their institutions have collapsed,"" Yunus said. ""Meanwhile, the microcredit system remains strong. No one has embezzled money, no one has fled the country with funds."" The chief adviser also pointed out that the question of regulatory oversight is not unique to Bangladesh. ""Every country that has implemented microcredit has faced challenges. ""I have repeatedly told them [other nations] they do not need to overthink the matter, as Bangladesh has already provided a solution. The Microcredit Regulatory Authority [MRA] has not only served Bangladesh but has also been instrumental in assisting many countries."" The MRA was founded in 2006, with a vision to create a transparent and accountable microfinance sector to help alleviate poverty and ensure sustainable national development. Yunus also recalled the period before the establishment of the MRA, when there was a push to bring non-government microfinance institutions (MFIs) under a regulatory framework. As of this March, there are 4.29 crore microcredit beneficiaries from MFIs -- 91 percent of whom are women. GOVT MULLS NEW LAW Bangladesh Bank Governor Ahsan H Mansur, who also chairs the MRA, said microcredit has made significant progress. ""Currently, the microcredit sector holds assets equivalent to 10 percent of the banking industry. More importantly, where traditional banking has weaknesses, microcredit has established a strong foundation."" He noted that members' savings have exceeded Tk 68,000 crore, while the accumulated surplus has surpassed Tk 61,000 crore. Mansur added that the microcredit system will face new challenges as the rural economy expands and agent banking continues to grow. ""Right now, microcredit institutions have around 26,000 branches, while agent banking branches have surpassed 20,000. This healthy competition is fostering formal financial integration into rural economies, and microfinance institutions must adapt to these challenges to remain relevant."" To improve the functionality of the microcredit sector, he said the regulatory authority and Bangladesh Bank will work together. ""A draft law on microcredit regulation has already been prepared and will soon be presented to the government."" Finance Adviser Salehuddin Ahmed emphasised that the regulations must be user-friendly rather than overly restrictive, ensuring that nothing is imposed forcefully. He also said the MRA should focus not only on regulation but also on promotion of the sector. Anisuzzaman Chowdhury, special assistant to the chief adviser, Nazma Mobarek, secretary to the Financial Institutions Division, and Prof Mohammed Helal Uddin, executive vice chairman of the MRA, also spoke at the event.","Sun May 18, 2025 12:07 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 02:48 AM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/address-banking-energy-issues-restore-business-confidence-3897106","Address banking, energy issues to restore business confidence","Bangladesh is dealing with one of its most challenging political and economic shifts, and the US tariff hike to 37 percent on its exports could worsen the situation. This could turn out to be a big problem for the economy, especially for the readymade garment (RMG) industry, which is Bangladesh's primary export item. If this tariff rate ends up being imposed, it could badly hurt the industry and cause foreign investors to lose interest in the country. ""This tariff is not just a policy shift—it is a crisis,"" said Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury (Parvez), president of the Bangladesh Chamber of Industries (BCI), in an interview with The Daily Star. ""It could trigger factory closures, massive job losses, and long-term damage to our export base,"" he said. In his assessment, Chowdhury warned that unless six critical fault lines were urgently addressed, Bangladesh risks slipping into a cycle of stagnation—while regional competitors surge ahead. Four of the six issues are the deterioration of law and order, growing challenges in compliance and labour regulation reforms, inadequate gas and power supplies, and vulnerabilities in the financial and banking sectors. The remaining two are burdensome and inconsistent taxation policies and the need to safeguard the future of exports and manufacturing. Chowdhury commented that rising crime and violence—often linked to elements of the past regime—along with politicised and demotivated law enforcement agencies and bureaucratic inefficiencies, were undermining law and order. This is also weakening governance and eroding public and investor confidence. ""We are at a crossroads. Bangladesh must act boldly and decisively—or risk losing relevance,"" he said. According to Chowdhury, the shifting geopolitical landscape—triggered by US-China trade tensions, war-induced supply chain realignments, and evolving Indo-Pacific strategies—has opened a rare window for Bangladesh. He warned that delays in reform would divert investment flows to better-prepared neighbours like Vietnam, India, and Indonesia. Industries in Bangladesh are under immense pressure, he said. The RMG sector, which generates more than 80 percent of the country's export earnings, has reported over $400 million in production losses due to factory shutdowns caused by labour unrest and compliance uncertainties, said the BCI president. The textiles, ceramics, and leather sectors are also facing a severe energy crisis, with frequent power cuts and gas shortages forcing operations to be scaled down, he said. Many manufacturers are struggling to stay afloat amid surging costs of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) and delayed government response, he said. ""We are paying the price for years of underinvestment in energy and infrastructure. Insufficient energy supply is the single biggest threat to our industrial backbone,"" he added. Rolling blackouts and erratic gas supply have disrupted production across sectors. The reliance on costly LNG imports has proven unsustainable. ""If we don't secure energy, we can't grow. It's that simple,"" he said. In spite of recommendations made by policy experts for years, Bangladesh continues to rank poorly in the ease of doing business, bogged down by delays in tax refunds, customs clearance, and factory registration processes, he said. Although Bangladesh has a young and growing labour force, employers struggle to find job-ready graduates. ""We are producing degrees, not skills,"" said Chowdhury. He advocated for stronger links between universities and industries, reforms in technical education, and private sector-led training programmes. ""Our demographic dividend is becoming a liability. That must change,"" he said. The BCI president highlighted that overdependence on garments for foreign currency earnings is a critical vulnerability, especially in the post-least developed country (LDC) era when duty-free market access will be phased out. He said Bangladesh's LDC graduation would revoke critical trade benefits, including waivers and preferential tariffs enabled by the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which establishes minimum standards for intellectual property protection. ""Graduation is irreversible. Without preparation, we will lose markets,"" he said. The pharmaceutical industry remains heavily reliant on imported active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and policy exemptions. Post-graduation, production costs will rise, and registering products in overseas markets will be more difficult, he said. ""If we do not prepare the sector, we risk being overtaken by Indian and Chinese firms—both locally and globally,"" he cautioned. Chowdhury also emphasised how Bangladesh was losing ground to regional peers. He drew comparisons with India, where states like Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh were offering subsidies of 30 percent to 45 percent on capital machinery, power rebates, and low-interest loan support to exporters. ""Vietnam delivers a container to the US at $1,100. We pay $1,800 from Chattogram. It's a logistics nightmare—and disastrous for competitiveness,"" he added. He called for deregulation in the energy sector, negotiations for free trade agreements (FTAs), digitalised customs processes, and incentives for new export sectors. ""The delay is costing us billions in lost orders, jobs, and reputation. You can't expect investors to commit when the political future is uncertain,"" added Chowdhury. The flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) has slowed as investors express concern over institutional unpredictability, contract enforcement, and rising political risk, he said. ""We need rule-based governance, timely justice, and a clear anti-corruption framework. Only then will capital flow back,"" he stressed. The BCI president warned that the current uncoordinated approach was pushing global buyers to opt for other countries having smoother compliance regimes. Urgent government action is needed to negotiate relief, expand into new markets, and restore investor confidence. ""Reform is no longer optional—it's our only way forward,"" said Chowdhury.","Sun May 18, 2025 12:01 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 12:55 AM"

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/revenue-management-risk-coming-under-executive-control-tib-3896966","Revenue management at risk of coming under executive control: TIB","Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) has expressed concern over the hasty issuance of the ordinance abolishing the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and creating two separate divisions for revenue policy and management. In a press release, the anti-graft watchdog warned that the move risks placing revenue management under the control of the executive branch. While the initiative was undertaken based on a rationale to separate revenue policy and revenue management to ensure policy independence, transparency, accountability, increase the tax-to-GDP ratio, and achieve revenue collection targets, it ultimately fails to allow the minimum degree of autonomy that revenue management should enjoy from the executive, TIB said. The statement by TIB comes at a time when revenue officials have been observing a pen-down strike with a three-point demand, including repealing the new Revenue Policy and Revenue Management Ordinance, 2025, which seeks the dissolution of the NBR and the Internal Resources Division. TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said there has been a longstanding demand to separate policy formulation and implementation in the revenue sector to establish transparency and accountability. This is because keeping these two crucial functions within a single structure has often led to conflicts of interest, collusive corruption, bureaucratic delays, and failures in meeting revenue targets—placing the country in embarrassing situations both nationally and internationally. The most recent advisory committee on revenue reform, along with various stakeholders and experts over time, has recommended decentralisation of revenue management. ""In this context, we want to consider the interim government's policy-level initiative positively. However, it raises serious questions as to why the ordinance was issued bypassing the recommendations of the advisory committee formed specifically for revenue reform,"" he said. ""In whose interest were these recommendations ignored during the formulation of the ordinance?"" he questioned. He added, ""In the name of decentralising the revenue board, the ordinance has effectively turned it into an institution under the control of the government, particularly the Ministry of Finance."" TIB, citing international best practices, said a country's revenue policy and management should be handled by an independent agency, board, or authority with legal safeguards to ensure it remains free from political and administrative influence. However, by disregarding the core recommendation of the advisory committee, the country's revenue system has now been transformed into two departments under the executive branch, it added. ""As a result, there remains ample scope for irregularities, including corruption and conflicts of interest, in the formulation and implementation of tax policies,"" according to the TIB press statement. It is not unreasonable to assume that these risks may even increase. To achieve the expected revenue targets and ensure transparency and accountability in revenue management, there is no alternative to placing the two newly formed departments beyond the reach of political and administrative influence through legal safeguards, it added. ""This decision by the government has already fuelled existing inter-cadre tensions—something that cannot be ignored."" Iftekharuzzaman said simply decentralising the revenue system will not automatically lead to the desired outcomes. He noted that it is well known that irregularities and collusive fraud in revenue assessment and collection are among the major means of tax evasion in Bangladesh. ""Despite various initiatives over the years, we have seen that the processes of filing income tax returns and collecting VAT are yet to be fully digitised; harassment and corruption have not declined; invoice fraud remains unchecked; tax evasion and money laundering continue unabated.""","Sat May 17, 2025 08:43 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 08:49 PM"

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/the-new-canvas-how-generative-ai-changing-the-future-creative-work-bangladesh-3896806","The new canvas: how generative AI is changing the future of creative work in Bangladesh","From the bustling alleys of Dhaka to the quiet courtyards of Netrokona, a new creative energy is rising across Bangladesh. Young people everywhere—armed with dreams, basic laptops, and a mobile connection—are entering the digital design world. Whether through a local ICT training centre in Jashore, an online course in Chattogram, or a freelancing group in Rajshahi, the goal is to earn, create, and connect with global opportunities. But while their ambition is clear, many are still learning tools that are no longer industry standard. The rest of the world is already designing with Artificial Intelligence, and Bangladesh must catch up fast. Today, generative AI is rewriting the rules of creativity. Tools like Stable Diffusion and DALL·E 3 allow users to turn simple text prompts into stunning visuals in seconds. A person can type ""a modern office logo with traditional motifs"" or ""a coastal village sunset for a tourism poster,"" and instantly receive professional-quality results. Meanwhile, platforms like Canva—already popular in Bangladesh—have introduced AI-based features that simplify layout design, video editing, and brand creation. The result is that what once took days of careful work can now be completed in minutes, with almost no prior training in graphic software. For a country with millions of digitally inclined youth, this is not just a trend—it's a turning point. More than 60 percent of Bangladesh's population is under 35. This massive demographic advantage—often called a demographic dividend—can either drive the economy forward or weigh it down, depending on how we prepare our youth. We can turn this population into a force of value generation with AI-powered design skills. If even a small percentage of our youth become successful AI-enhanced freelancers or entrepreneurs, the country could earn billions in annual income, reduce youth unemployment, and grow a sustainable, knowledge-based export sector. This is not a theory; this is already happening. In Khulna, a group of final-year students uses Canva and DALL·E 3 to create product packaging for small businesses in the UAE. In Bogura, a freelancer who switched from traditional Photoshop to Stable Diffusion now handles design tasks for three international clients and has tripled his income. In Barishal, a group of girls from a local ICT centre are designing Facebook campaigns for local fashion brands using Canva's AI layout generator. In Mymensingh, a graduate with a diploma now creates concept art for indie game developers in Germany using prompt-based visual creation through AI tools. These are not rare cases but early signals of a larger possibility. If we can train and mobilise one million youth in AI-powered design and content creation, each earning even $300 per month, that would mean over $3.6 billion flowing into the economy annually—without factories, without exports, and with minimal infrastructure. That is the cumulative impact we are ignoring at our own risk. But this impact is not just economic. When a young woman in Nilphamari earns her first dollar by selling an AI-generated design on Etsy, she gains income, dignity, and confidence. When a boy in Rangpur becomes a visual storyteller using Canva's AI tools, he doesn't need to migrate for work—he brings opportunity home. When a madrasa graduate in Cumilla learns to design Da'wah posters with DALL·E 3 and shares them online, he's contributing to community education while building digital skills. This is how we create an inclusive economy—by giving tools, access, and belief to every corner of society. The government of Bangladesh has already committed to digital development through initiatives like the ICT Division's skills programmes, LEDP, and SEIP. However, most of these training curricula were created before the rise of AI. They taught basic freelancing, graphic design, and content marketing, but now need to evolve rapidly to meet global standards. We must revise our national curriculum in public education and private training centres to include Stable Diffusion, DALL·E 3, Canva AI, and prompt engineering as part of regular training. Our instructors must be retrained. Our content must be translated into Bangla. And our delivery must reach every district—from Cox's Bazar to Thakurgaon. A district-focused model can multiply this impact. In Rajshahi, known for its rich culture and artistic heritage, AI can help digitise traditional patterns into sellable global merchandise. In Narayanganj, the design needs of small garment exporters can be supported by local youth trained in prompt-based branding. In Noakhali, AI-powered design kiosks can be set up in union digital centres, helping farmers or shopkeepers make marketing posters. Sylhet's diaspora connections can be tapped by creating freelance design agencies that serve the UK and European Bangladeshi community. In Bandarban, trained tribal youth can build visual stories of their heritage, promote tourism, and sell creative content globally. The canvas is limitless—if we provide the brush. The private sector must join this movement. Internet providers, banks, telecom companies, NGOs, and universities can co-host AI design bootcamps, sponsor creative challenges, and offer microgrants to rural AI creators. A student in Gopalganj should not be denied the future because they didn't have Canva Pro access or didn't hear of DALL·E 3. Inclusion must be intentional. Bangladesh has consistently proven that it can adapt and leapfrog. From basic phones to mobile banking, garments to digital commerce, we move when mobilised. Now is the time to mobilise around generative AI—not as a tech buzzword but as a national tool for income, innovation, and inspiration. With proper direction, this movement could become our next garment industry—only brighter, cleaner, and fully digital. Our young people are ready. They are creative, connected, and courageous. All they need now is guidance, access, and trust. We must give them the tools of tomorrow—today. Let us not wait for the future to arrive. Let us build it—with our youth, talent, and a new canvas filled with AI-powered creativity.

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/without-capital-markets-reform-bangladesh-will-stay-invisible-the-world-3896686","Without capital markets reform, Bangladesh will stay invisible to the world","On May 11, the Government of Bangladesh made a welcome announcement: a five-point directive to reform the country's capital markets. The goal is to improve transparency, regulatory integrity, and investor confidence—an acknowledgement that the current system is no longer fit for purpose. It's the right move. But unless this decision is followed by bold, structural action, it risks becoming yet another well-meaning reform lost in translation. Here's why this moment matters. Over $100 trillion is allocated globally every year by institutional investors—pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, and endowments. This capital doesn't chase headlines or potential. It follows systems: transparency, liquidity, governance, and access. But here's the key: that capital doesn't move based on passion or pitch decks. Someone at Fidelity, Vanguard, or a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi doesn't wake up and decide to explore Bangladesh because of a headline. They follow mandates—pre-allocated capital flows tied to global indices like MSCI Frontier and Emerging Markets. If Bangladesh isn't in those benchmarks, it often isn't even legally investable for them. No matter how promising the story, how many ""foreign experts"" are brought in, or how many reforms are made—if you're outside the system, you don't exist. Bangladesh currently holds a negligible weight in the MSCI Frontier Index. To fix this, we must first strengthen our presence there, then aim for graduation into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index—where serious, recurring capital flows begin. To put this in perspective: Vietnam's 1 percent MSCI EM allocation gives it access to over $300 billion in global flows every year. Bangladesh, in contrast, has received less than $20 billion in total FDI in its entire history. And this shift won't happen through press releases alone. It requires capital markets professionals at the table and direct engagement with the global institutions and investors who make these decisions. Bangladesh must build an ongoing feedback loop with actual global investors—those managing billions in emerging and frontier market mandates. We need to understand what's keeping them out, what reforms would pull them in, and how we can align our systems with global standards. Too often, policy is made in isolation. But investor mandates are shaped by real constraints. Unless we engage the very people deploying this capital, we risk designing solutions no one can actually use. In Bangladesh, capital markets are still widely misunderstood—too often viewed as speculative gambling dens or playgrounds for the well-connected. That perception is not only outdated—it's actively holding back the entire economy. A mature capital market is what allows a country to finance its future without taking on more debt. It brings in institutional capital—patient, long-term money that funds infrastructure, industry, and innovation. It gives growing businesses access to capital without having to trade favours or rely on opaque networks. Most importantly, it creates jobs. When companies raise capital, they hire. Engineers, compliance officers, operations leads, analysts, designers, lawyers, and researchers. They expand across borders, invest in local talent, and reinvest in innovation. Capital markets also give families, founders, and state-owned enterprises tools to restructure balance sheets—freeing them to grow, fix debt burdens, or scale in ways they never could through traditional lending channels. Without functioning capital markets, Bangladeshi companies stay small, not because of a lack of ambition, but because of a lack of access. We talk endlessly about brain drain, but we rarely ask why it's happening. Bangladeshis are working at the highest levels of global capital markets—on trading desks in New York, in sovereign funds in the Gulf, at regulatory bodies in Singapore, London, and beyond. They haven't stayed away out of disinterest or disloyalty. They've stayed away because there hasn't been a serious, credible system back home where their expertise could be applied—and respected. Now, the government has announced that it will bring in foreign experts to support capital markets reform. That's a welcome step. But before we look outward, we must ask: have we looked inward? We have a world-class bench of Bangladeshi professionals already embedded in the global financial system—people who understand how MSCI works, how capital moves, how systems are reformed, and how institutions are built. If we fail to engage them now, we risk not only overlooking our most relevant talent—but undermining the very idea of self-determined reform. The hunger to return is real. What's missing is opportunity—and trust in a process that values global knowledge without political interference. Capital market reform is the clearest signal we can send to our diaspora that Bangladesh is finally serious. That the country isn't just asking for help—it's ready to build with those who've done it before. Not as token advisors, but as co-architects of the system. We don't need to invent a new playbook. Countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Morocco, and Romania have already executed successful reform. Here's what a credible roadmap looks like: These reforms are not optional. They are the minimum price of admission to the trillions of dollars allocated every year. Exits build confidence, confidence attracts capital Capital doesn't just need access—it demands an exit. Without that, it won't enter. Functioning markets create predictable exits: IPOs, secondary offerings, bond redemptions. That's why India and Indonesia consistently attract capital across sectors and cycles. Investors trust the systems there. Bangladesh must earn that same trust—not through PR, but through performance. Global capital is going somewhere. If not to Bangladesh, it will go to Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, or Morocco—not because they're inherently better, but because they built what investors need while we stood still. The math is stark: Meanwhile, regional peers such as Indonesia and the Philippines continue to attract substantially more foreign portfolio investment because they've aligned with global standards Global capital is like water. It follows the path of least resistance. We haven't built the pipes—so it flows around us. And the result? Capital markets reform isn't about tweaking the DSE or commissioning another white paper. It's about building the financial backbone of a modern economy that attracts global capital on our terms—not through charity, but through credibility. The government's recent directive is a start. But to succeed, it must engage Bangladeshi talent from around the world—people who've already done this elsewhere and are ready to help rebuild here. This isn't just financial housekeeping. It's nation-building. We can keep waiting for the world to recognise us—or we can build the systems that make us impossible to ignore. The talent is ready. The capital is waiting. It's time to finally build a system worthy of both.   Rahat Ahmed is the founder & managing partner of Anchorless Bangladesh, a New York-based investment firm focused on channelling global capital into Bangladeshi opportunities.

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/economy/news/how-chattogram-built-its-economic-legacy-3896356","How Chattogram built its economic legacy","Picture a crowded harbour where the salty seabreeze carries whispers of far-off lands, where merchants of all creed and caste haggle over silks and spices, and where towering ships of all varieties – Chinese junks, Arab dhows, and Portuguese carracks – sway gently in the waters of the Bay of Bengal. One of the most famous harbours in ancient times, the port in Chattogram has been the ultimate pit stop for traders, explorers, and fortune-seekers for over 2,000 years. Thanks to its strategic geographic location as a natural sea harbour that offers access to vast plainlands but remains surrounded by hillocks, the anchorage in Chattogram has featured in some of the richest chapters of history. The maritime Silk Road -- the ocean-based sibling of the famous caravan trails -- ran straight through the Bay of Bengal, with the jetties in Chattogram being the star player. All the way back in the 4th century BC, sailors were dropping anchor here, turning the Bay of Bengal into a buzzing hub of commerce. By the 2nd century AD, the legendary geographer Claudius Ptolemy had inked the location onto his world map, mentioning it as one of the finest ports in the Eastern World. Five centuries later, Chinese traveller Xuanzang declared it ""a misty beauty emerging out of the misty water"", as mentioned in Routledge's International Dictionary of Historic Places. Much later, even Marco Polo was said to be left in awe of the lush landscape that provided the backdrop for the harbour. Throughout chapters of chaos, conquest and colonisation, the port of Chittagong always emerged as a thriving commercial hub, whether it was when Arab merchants dominated in the 9th century or under Portuguese hold in the 1500s.  WHERE PIONEERING INDUSTRIES FOUND THEIR FEET
 Since days of yore, the bustling landscape of trade and commerce due to the proximity to the port, in combination with hinterland connectivity, has seen the Chittagong region rise to the top as the go-to spot for export-oriented industries. For example, although Sylhet dominates the scene now, tea production in Bangladesh started in a hilly area of Chattogram in 1843. The region also sparked the boom in export-oriented readymade garments, which now account for over 80 percent of the country's export basket, in 1977, when the nation's first RMG unit was built in Kalurghat industrial area. Furthermore, the oldest and most historic tea trading hub in the country was established in the region in 1949, followed shortly after by the country's pioneering steel re-rolling company, which found a home in the region's Nasirabad industrial area in 1952. Additionally, the country's only state-owned fuel oil refinery, Eastern Refinery Limited (ERL), was established in the region in 1968. Currently, a subsidiary of the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), which is also headquartered in the division, ERL has a refining capacity of 1.5 million tonnes. Likewise, state-owned Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited (CUFL), along with its two associated units, Diammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd and local multinational joint venture plant Karnaphuli Fertilizer Company Limited, are located on the southern bank of the Karnaphuli river, with jetty facilities near the port. Playing host to the country's premier seaport also made Chattogram the ideal venue to host the nation's first export-processing zone, which was developed in South Halishahar in 1983.  SITAKUNDA: A STORY OF TRANSFORMATION
 The numbers, provided by the Department of Inspections for Factories and Establishments (DIFE), show that there are a total of 4,007 registered manufacturing industrial units in greater Chattogram, from Feni to Cox's Bazar, excluding those in export processing zones. Of these, around 2,500 are now operational. Data from Industrial Police shows that around 1,650 small, medium and heavy industrial units are now operational in Chattogram. To take a closer look, one must journey to this south-eastern part of the country. And among stories of industrial development, the Sitakunda upazila is a standout. Before the Dhaka-Chattogram highway, widely considered the country's economic lifeline, reaches the port city, it traverses through this upazila. This twist of fate has turned the nearly 500 square kilometre sub-district into a bustling industrial hub, with over 200 industrial units springing up. On one side of the highway, along the sandy beach on the Bay of Bengal, you will find the world's largest ship-breaking industry by volume, handling around half of the world's discarded ships.  On the other side, one can witness various industrial units ranging from steel re-rolling plants, corrugated iron (CI) sheet manufacturing units, cement factories, glass factories, jute mills, textile mills, vehicle assembling units and even container depots. Four large steel plants of leading business groups -- Abul Khair Group, BSRM Group, GPH Group Steel Mills and KSRM -- and around 30 traditional and semi-automated mills are located in Sitakunda, meeting nearly 50 percent of the nation's total demand for steel. Four out of the five major CI sheet-making plants are also set up in the sub-district, meeting 70 percent of the country's total demand. These four plants are owned by Abul Khair Group, PHP Family, KDS Group and TK Group. Despite the massive scale of operations there, Sitakunda remains just a small glimpse into the overall scenario in recent times. Looking back at history, the Chattogram region's impact on key domestic industries becomes undeniable.  THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE STEEL SECTOR
 There was no steel plant on Bangladeshi soil until 1952. That year, a few merchants hailing from Gujrat took separate initiatives, setting up three or four small manual rod-making plants in Chattogram. While the other initiatives did not progress well, Akberali Africawala's family, the founders of the first plant under what is now the BSRM Group, found success. The country's first billet-making plant, the state-owned Chittagong Steel Mills, was also founded here in 1967 before being shuttered 39 years later, paving the way for private initiatives in the sector to flourish. Although there are around 42 steelmakers in Bangladesh, the four leading producers are based in Chattogram and currently cater to around 53 percent of the nation's total demand, according to market studies and industry insiders. These four major steelmakers are: Bangladesh Steel Re-Rolling Mills (BSRM), Abul Khair Steel (AKS), GPH Ispat and Kabir Steel Re-Rolling Mills (KSRM). According to BigMint, a platform for commodity price reporting, market intelligence and consulting, BSRM caters to around 25 percent of domestic demand while AKS contributes 14 percent, GPH 8 percent and KSRM 6 percent. At present, the country's steel-makers have a combined capacity of 90 lakh tonnes each year against an annual requirement of around 70 lakh tonnes. A BigMint study shows that steel factories in Chattogram account for around 62 percent of total steel-melting capacity. BSRM Managing Director Aameir Alihussain said Chattogram has become the place to be for all heavy industries, not only the steel sector, mainly due to its proximity to the port. Since the steel industry is highly dependent on imports for raw materials, Alihussain said the advantage of being as close to the port as possible comes in the form of low transport costs. ""If you set up a factory anywhere else, such as Dhaka, you need to transport raw materials all the way to Dhaka, and then the finished products need to be brought here again for sale. That makes transport costs very high,"" he said. No steel factory located in Dhaka sells its products in the Chattogram market since it is unviable, he added, saying that heavy industry must be set up in Chattogram. HUB FOR CI SHEET INDUSTRY Another pioneering moment came with the establishment of the state-owned Chittagong Steel Mill in 1967, signalling the beginning of domestic production of corrugated iron (CI) sheets used widely for housing and factory roofing. However, this factory proved inadequate to meet domestic demand. So, the private sector stepped up in the mid-80s, with some Chattogram-based businesses initiating CI sheet production by importing intermediate raw materials. Between 1998 and 2004, five Chattogram-based industrial groups, namely Abul Khair, PHP, TK, KDS and S Alam Group, set up large factories to manufacture raw materials such as cold rolled coils to produce CI sheets. At present, these five manufacturers control 99 percent of the CI sheet market. These factories have also invested in producing more durable and multi-dimensional CI sheet products. SHINING BRIGHTEST IN SHIP-BUILDING Around 200 registered shipbuilding yards are active across the country, most of which are located in the Narayanganj area. However, these are mostly conventional operations making commodity and passenger vessels for domestic use. In the past 25 years, at least 20 shipyards have been modernised and are now capable of building international standard vessels upon extensive modification. Two out of these 20 shipyards, namely Chattogram-based Western Marine Shipyard and Dhaka-based Ananda Shipyard and Slipways Limited, have set a new benchmark by building and exporting a total of 44 ocean-going vessels since 2007. Chattogram's stake in this particular segment is also higher than Dhaka's. Out of the 44 ships exported from Bangladesh so far, 34 were built by Western Marine. The country's first export processing zone was set up in Chattogram in 1983. However, although it offered a sprawling 453 acres of land, only a few industrial units called it home. In the 42 years since, the number has climbed to 144, including 78 RMG factories. Since all 501 industrial plots in the zone were allocated around 15 years ago, currently, the factories here are expanding vertically. The factories at the Chittagong Export Processing Zone exported goods worth $1.8 billion in the first nine months of this fiscal year. The largest privately-owned EPZ, the Korean Export Processing Zone (KEPZ), was also set up in Chattogram's Anwara upazila in 1999. A subsidiary of the South Korean Youngone Corporation, the KEPZ currently hosts 48 industrial units, largely under the ownership of Youngone. Presently, KEPZ factories export goods worth approximately $400 million each year. Another state-run EPZ, named the Karnaphuli EPZ, was set up in 2006. It now has 48 industrial units, including 23 RMG factories, employing over 77,000 individuals. 'COMMERCIAL CAPITAL' IN NAME ONLY Although the country's second-most populous city is often termed the commercial capital in modern day, many believe it remains a mere political slogan in light of the challenges that the city and the region as a whole still face. A lack of proper infrastructural development and policy support, courtesy of the negligence of policymakers,  forced many entrepreneurs to gradually shift their businesses to Dhaka. Yet, the region remains at the heart of the country's economy, and the reason for that is simple. The Chattogram port is the premier driver of the country's economic engine, facilitating 92 percent of Bangladesh's seaborne trade while handling 98 percent of the country's total containerised goods transport. However, its immense economic potential is stifled by challenges brought on by inadequate infrastructure development and a heavy reliance on Dhaka for crucial regulatory support for business. Congestion at the Chattogram Port, higher cargo handling costs, higher logistics and transport costs, and inadequate transportation networks hinder the city's economic growth. Satyajit Barman, head of grain in TK Group, said almost 85 percent of the food grain trading business, once based in Khatunganj, has shifted to Dhaka due to exorbitant cargo handling and transport costs. Bad management of warehouses and illogical weight limits on carrying cargo transport along the Dhaka-Chattogram highway have also had an impact. Most businesses stressed the need to address these issues to help Chattogram realise its full potential. From its golden days to its pivotal role in Bangladesh's industrial rise, Chattogram has always thrived at the intersection of history and opportunity. Yet, for all its past glory and present potential, the city's future now depends on overcoming infrastructural bottlenecks and policy neglect.","Sat May 17, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 11:21 AM"

When contacted, central bank spokesperson Arief Hossain Khan said this development amounted to ""fraud"", as the management board of Nagad remained intact and had informed the central bank that it did not appoint any CEO. Arief said the central bank had learnt that former CEO Tanvir A Mishuk named the new chief executive via email. ""But how can a former CEO appoint a new CEO?"" asked Arief, who also serves as executive director of the central bank's Payment Systems Department. ""This appointment is illegal,"" he said. Following a political transition, Bangladesh Bank took over Nagad in September last year and formed a management board to oversee its operations. KAS Murshid, former director general of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, was initially appointed to lead the board, but he recently resigned. Former AB Bank managing director Kaiser A Chowdhury has since taken over as its new head. When contacted, Kaiser declined to comment on the issue. A Nagad official, requesting anonymity, said Shafayet had begun acting as CEO remotely. He has reportedly appointed new personnel and dismissed several others. Efforts by The Daily Star to reach Shafayet via phone and WhatsApp were unsuccessful. In a separate development, the government on Thursday directed the Directorate of Posts to assume overall responsibility for Nagad. Citing a Supreme Court Appellate Division order in Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 177 of 2025, the directorate said an interim government official instructed it to urgently take charge of Nagad's management, following the stay on the administrator's appointment. To implement the directive, a committee has been formed. The committee will be physically present at Nagad's head office and other relevant locations as necessary and submit periodic reports, according to the letter. Earlier, the Appellate Division stayed Bangladesh Bank's August 2024 decision to dissolve Nagad's board and appoint an administrator. It also paused a High Court verdict, which had upheld that decision. Bangladesh Bank has since sought to overturn the stay, and a hearing is scheduled for May 19 in the Appellate Division, said Arief. After taking charge, the administrator uncovered numerous alleged irregularities at Nagad. One major issue was a Tk 600 crore deficit created by issuing e-money without corresponding cash backing, an act considered a serious offence in the financial sector. In another instance, unauthorised withdrawals totalling Tk 1,711 crore were reportedly made over the years through 41 distribution accounts meant for government allowances. The administrator's team had reported these findings to the director general of the Directorate of Posts. Contacted, Tanvir Mishuk, former managing director and CEO of Nagad, told The Daily Star that the court's stay on the activities of the central bank-appointed administrator effectively reinstated the previous board, which then appointed an interim CEO. Asked about his role in the appointment, Mishuk said he recommended Shafayet as CEO at the board's request. He also claimed that the central bank-appointed management board is no longer valid following the court's stay order.","Fri May 16, 2025 12:30 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 02:53 PM"
"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/currency-unleashed-handle-care-3895786","Currency unleashed:  Handle with care","The Bangladesh Bank (BB) has, somewhat unexpectedly, reverted to the exchange rate regime announced on December 31, 2024, effectively transitioning the country into a free-floating currency system. Authorised dealers are now permitted to buy and sell foreign currency at freely negotiated rates, allowing the taka to be determined by market forces rather than being pegged or constrained within a fixed range. BB has also repealed the January 2, 2025, circular that imposed a Tk 1 spread between buying and selling rates. This decision is a pragmatic step, regardless of whether it was motivated by the necessity of meeting IMF program conditions for the 4th and 5th disbursements. The market appears ready to move beyond the previous ""crawling peg"" system, which maintained a fixed spread and a ceiling on selling rates for authorised dealers. Following the settlement of several accumulated payments in December, conditions in the foreign exchange market improved—remittances surged, imports remained weak, and illicit capital outflows continued slumping. As a result, the policy-imposed spread and ceiling often failed to be binding. BB hardly sold dollars in the market in the last five months. This shift toward a flexible exchange rate regime represents an opportunity for market participants to adapt to a framework that prioritises responsiveness to global and local economic factors. It is a bold step signalling confidence in the ability of the market to determine fair and competitive exchange rates without relying on heavy-handed intervention. By tethering less to fixed policies and more to macroeconomic realities, the switch aligns with international practices, providing an avenue for greater integration into the global financial system. Bangladesh is inherently vulnerable to external shocks, including volatile global commodity prices, economic downturns among major trading partners, and natural disasters. If the BB maintains its commitment to a flexible exchange rate, without abrupt policy reversals seen in the past, the taka can adjust dynamically in response to these external pressures. This shift will reduce the need for constant intervention by BB, alleviating the strain on foreign exchange reserves and removing the complexities of monitoring currency market operations. A flexible exchange rate empowers businesses and investors to engage in transactions based on actual market conditions rather than depending on BB for foreign exchange access. This leads to more efficient pricing of goods, services, and investments, fostering economic agility. Foreign investors often favour economies with market-driven exchange rates, as they enhance transparency and minimise risks associated with sudden policy-driven currency fluctuations. Market efficiency cannot be taken for granted. Fortunately, the BB has already implemented a reporting system that provides foreign exchange transaction data twice daily for transactions of one lakh US dollars or more. This mechanism is now fully operational. Additionally, BB publishes a daily reference benchmark rate, calculated as the weighted average of rates reported by ADs. With no incentive to misreport under the new regime, this would serve as a valuable anchor for setting competitive exchange rates. Every exchange rate regime must strike a balance between rate flexibility and pressure on foreign exchange reserves. A flexible system reduces the burden on reserves by allowing the exchange rate to adjust naturally in response to supply or demand fluctuations. However, if such fluctuations lead to excessive volatility, the need for intervention using official reserves increases. To counter this, BB is committed to employing a market-based intervention strategy designed to deter speculative behaviour and address sudden shortages in foreign currency. With a flexible exchange rate, BB can now shift its focus toward domestic economic priorities such as inflation control, employment growth, and financial stability instead of continuously defending the currency. That said, effective management of the float requires ongoing vigilance. Several countries—including India, Singapore, Indonesia, and Brazil—have successfully balanced market-driven currency valuation with strategic interventions, providing useful models for Bangladesh to follow. Moreover, Bangladesh's own experience from 2003 to 2022 reinforces the confidence that it can manage this system effectively. BB should intervene only when necessary, such as during periods of natural disasters or large, unanticipated financial shocks. Maintaining adequate foreign exchange reserves would enable BB to support the taka to cope with such shocks while instilling investor confidence. Regular and transparent communication from the BB on monetary and exchange rate policies would help prevent speculation and panic. Ensuring strong coordination between monetary and fiscal policies would further safeguard against risks associated with currency fluctuations.

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/dollar-remains-stable-bb-adopts-market-based-rate-3895791","Dollar remains stable as BB adopts market-based rate","The US dollar rate remained stable yesterday although Bangladesh adopted a market-based exchange rate regime the day before, giving some relief to businesses and importers. The dollar rate, which has hovered between Tk 122 and Tk 122.50 for the past few months, did not change after the market-based exchange rate was introduced. The move to a more flexible, market-oriented exchange rate system was made to ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves and meet a key condition tied to a $4.7 billion loan programme with the International Monetary Fund. On May 14, the central bank lifted the Tk 1 spread between buying and selling rates of the US dollar by repealing a directive issued in January. At the same time, it reinstated a circular issued in December 2024, allowing banks to ""freely"" negotiate the US dollar rate for both interbank and customer transactions. That marked a formal return to a pricing framework driven by demand and supply. Bankers say that banks are expected to have an adequate supply of dollars due to increased remittance inflows ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. A treasury head of a private bank, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the central bank and other authorities have instructed everyone to play a sensible role in the current situation. Since Eid-ul-Azha is approaching, dollar flow is expected to increase. There is confidence among all parties regarding this, so there is no volatility in the market, the official said, opining that there will be no volatility in the country's dollar market in the coming days. Over the past 15 days, the US dollar has been bought at Tk 121 to Tk 122 and sold at Tk 122.30 to Tk 122.50, he added. At an event yesterday, Bangladesh Bank Deputy Governor Md Habibur Rahman said that if the rate rises beyond the desired level, Bangladesh Bank will intervene, and they have the tools to do so. Although the taka's exchange rate fluctuated slightly on Wednesday after moving to a market-based dollar rate, there was no significant depreciation, he added. In other words, there was no pressure for devaluation. The situation will be monitored for another day or two, he said. ""Then it will become clear what will happen. It appears that a good balance has been established between the demand and supply of foreign currency. As a result, there will be no unwanted depreciation or pressure on the taka's exchange rate,"" he said.","Fri May 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 09:51 AM"

The bank posted a 4 percent year-on-year rise in profit in the January-March quarter, reaching Tk 185.28 crore, according to its financial statements. The first quarter follows the Tk 780 crore profit the bank made in the financial year 2024. Its earnings per share stood at Tk 1.60 for the first quarter, up from Tk 1.54 (restated) in the same period a year earlier. Its consolidated net operating cash flow per share (NOCFPS) surged to Tk 19.69 from Tk 9.25 (restated) in the same quarter of 2024. The significant improvement in NOCFPS reflects the bank's strategic focus on high-yield lending, fee and commission income diversification, cost optimisation, and digital transformation, the bank said. It attributed the rise in NOCFPS to increased customer deposits and a rise in other liabilities during the quarter that ended on March 31, 2025.

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/crisis-ignored-crisis-ensured-3895771","Crisis ignored, crisis ensured","If you place a frog in cold water and gradually heat it, the frog won't react; it just adjusts, thinking ""I can handle this"". But as the temperature keeps rising, it reaches a point where the frog realises it must escape. Sadly, by then, it's too weak to jump. It didn't die from the heat; it died from not acting in time. That's the ""Boiling Frog Syndrome"". In life, we often behave like that frog, tolerating injustice, disrespect, or pain, hoping things will improve. Problems that could have been stopped early grow beyond control. By the time we are ready to react, we are too exhausted, too broken or too old. The lesson? Don't wait until you have no strength left. Set your boundaries, speak up, and protect your self-respect before you end up like the frog that wanted to survive but could not. The ""Boiling Frog Syndrome"" is a metaphor, not a proven science. But it reflects human behaviour—we often adapt to worsening situations instead of reacting. In Bangladesh, this is seen in how people tolerate corruption, injustice, workplace exploitation, or poor governance, thinking ""it's still manageable"". Over time, these problems escalate, and when people finally want to act, they are too drained or powerless or victims of the situation, just like the frog. Psychological inertia is the tendency to stick to the status quo, even when change would be beneficial, mirroring the ""Boiling Frog Syndrome"", where people ignore the gradual decline until it's too late. Studies show that this inertia causes individuals to resist change, even when faced with new, opposing facts. A related concept, emotional inertia, refers to staying stuck in the same emotional state. Research links higher emotional inertia to issues like depression and low self-esteem, as individuals struggle to adapt emotionally to shifting situations, worsening their mental well-being over time. Several studies have explored psychological and emotional inertia—the human tendency to resist change even when beneficial. A study in Psychological Medicine found that individuals with high emotional inertia are more prone to depression and low self-esteem. Another study in Frontiers in Psychology linked brain activity to emotional adaptability, showing a neurological basis for inertia. In Bangladesh, similar patterns are seen in workplace stagnation, poor public health habits, and environmental complacency, highlighting the need for timely action. In our corporate and political culture, we rarely flinch when injustice happens, as long as it's happening to someone else. A colleague gets disrespected, a friend is sidelined, a relative is mistreated, and we watch silently, hoping the heat won't reach us. But here's the catch: if the water's warming for them, it's only a matter of time before it boils for you, too. This bystander syndrome, masked as ""not my problem"", is just another form of selfishness. Unlike Bollywood, there's no heroic music cue for someone to step in. If we wait to act only when we are the victim, we will all be cooked together - one silent frog at a time. To escape the boiling frog fate, we must stop pretending ""it's not that bad yet"". In Bangladesh, endurance is often mistaken for wisdom. But there's nothing wise about waiting until it's too late to act. Speak up early, demand accountability, track the decline with data, and strengthen your emotional spine. Institutions won't fix themselves, nor will your boss's toxic behaviour. Act while you still have the energy, because you might already be dinner by the time you realise you're boiling. Timely decisions are not just wise—they're vital. For corporates, acting early means staying competitive, attracting talent, and leading change. In Bangladesh, we don't jump out, form a committee, draft a five-year action plan, and host a workshop on ""frog resilience"". By the time real action kicks in, we are fully boiled, the budget's gone, and everyone's been promoted. Even frogs here need policy reform to survive.

New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9 on tariff hikes for major trading partners. ""It is very hard to sell in India, and they are offering us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariffs,"" Trump said in a meeting with executives in the Qatari capital Doha. Reuters has reported that New Delhi has offered to reduce duties to zero on 60 percent of tariff lines in a first phase of the deal under negotiation with Washington, while offering preferential access to nearly 90 percent of the merchandise India imports from the US. India's equity benchmarks jumped to a seven-month high after Trump's comment on the deal with India. The Indian trade ministry did not reply to a mail seeking comments on the proposed deal. Trump in Doha said he had confronted Apple's CEO Tim Cook about shifting production to India, as the American company moves to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China. ""Tim, we treated you very good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years ... we are not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well, we want you to build here"", Trump recalled himself telling Cook, who was not in the Doha meeting. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and Apple's suppliers have ramped up production in the country. In March, Apple's main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the U.S., an all-time high, to bypass Trump's impending tariffs. The United States is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129 billion in 2024. The trade balance is currently in favour of India, which runs a $45.7 billion surplus with the US. India's trade minister Piyush Goyal will lead a trade delegation to the United States starting May 16 to advance trade negotiations, two government officials told Reuters on Tuesday. India has some of the world's highest tariffs on imports, and Trump has previously called India a ""tariff abuser"".","Fri May 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 12:43 AM"

The other two demands are the public disclosure of a state advisory committee's report on reforms for the NBR, which was submitted to the finance ministry, and inclusive, consultative, sustainable reforms for the revenue administration. They made the announcement at a press briefing at the NBR's headquarters following a three-hour work abstention throughout the country for a second consecutive day. However, as before, international passenger services, export activities, and preparations for the national budget remained outside the purview of the strike. ""We want a comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable reform of the revenue system, based on open discussion on the advisory report,"" said Sefat-E-Mariam, additional commissioner of the NBR, at the press conference. ""…and a white paper on the country's economic situation, engaging stakeholders, business associations, civil society, political leadership, and all relevant parties,"" she said. ""We are not opposed to reforming the NBR. Officers and employees at all levels of the NBR have long been advocating for reforms in the revenue system,"" she said. ""What we want is for these reforms to be rational and widely acceptable, reflecting the national interest and a development-oriented philosophy,"" said Mariam. The revenue administration should become more effective, progressive, and free from corruption, and the reform process must not be used as a tool to serve the vested interests of any particular group, she added. She also raised questions over the advisory committee's recommendations not being made public. ""A special advisory committee was formed to split the NBR into two divisions, but unlike other reform reports published online, this committee's report was neither made public nor shared with the NBR,"" she said. Key stakeholders, like the NBR, were kept completely in the dark. The government hastily dissolved the committee without publishing the report or holding consultations, raising suspicion, she said. At the briefing, Mostafizur Rahman, deputy commissioner of the NBR, and Nipun Chakma, deputy commissioner, were present. The NBR staff, under the banner of ""NBR Reform Unity Council"", announced the strike last Tuesday after the government issued the new ordinance the night before. In the new ordinance, the government announced that it had decided to dissolve the NBR and Internal Resources Division, replacing them with a Revenue Policy Division and a Revenue Implementation Division. Both would run under the Ministry of Finance. According to the ordinance, the policy division will be responsible for formulating tax policies and setting tariffs, while the implementation division will oversee tax collection and enforcement of related rules and regulations. Protesters within the customs and income tax cadres argue that the ordinance sidelined experienced tax professionals by transferring policymaking powers to officials from the general administration and other cadres. Meanwhile, the NBR's public relations officer announced that NBR Chairman Abdur Rahman Khan would hold a press conference in front of the NBR headquarters in the afternoon yesterday. However, no briefing took place. Moreover, two groups of people, who admitted that they were neither officials nor staff of the NBR, staged demonstrations before the headquarters under the banners ""Anti-fascist People"" and ""People's Rights Party"". One group demanded the resignation of the NBR chairman, while the other group came to voice their opposition against it.","Fri May 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 09:50 AM"

Speaking at the launch of the inaugural edition of the Monthly Macroeconomic Insights (MMI) by the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh (PRI) at its Banani office yesterday, experts and economists expressed cautious optimism about the country's economic trajectory. The MMI, a new analytical initiative by PRI's Center for Macroeconomic Analysis (CMEA), has been developed with support from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). ""The economy is on a recovery path,"" said Ashikur Rahman, principal economist at PRI, calling it a pivotal phase marked by cautious optimism. He termed the dissolution of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and the Bank Resolution Order Ordinance 2025 as bold and timely steps by the interim government. He said these reforms aim to ensure institutional clarity and long-term economic stability. Addressing the event, Anisuzzaman Chowdhury, special assistant to the chief adviser, emphasised an urgent need to rebuild Bangladesh's social capital alongside reinforcing its economic foundations. He remarked that while the country has progressed significantly in infrastructure and financial capacity, the erosion of social cohesion and public trust now poses a deeper, long-term threat. ""We need hard reforms and honest reflection,"" he said. ""We are not poor in financial terms alone; our social fabric is also under strain."" Drawing from his early life experiences, Chowdhury reflected on how countries like South Korea and Japan overcame hardship through strategic vision, coordinated reforms, and long-term commitment. ""They didn't just push reforms -- they fixed goals and stayed the course. That's what we need."" Regarding Bangladesh's upcoming graduation from the least developed country (LDC) club, he called it both a challenge and an opportunity. ""It's not just about metrics. Without a clear vision, reforms alone won't deliver. We need policy coherence."" He also pointed out that high interest rates, low investor confidence, and disjointed policies are hampering economic diversification. ""Why invest in capital markets when banks offer 12 percent with less risk?"" Md Habibur Rahman, deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, said Bangladesh's economic indicators are showing signs of gradual stability, driven by improvements in the current account and balance of payments. ""Exchange rate liberalisation will benefit Bangladesh on multiple fronts,"" he said. He added that the macroeconomic situation has become more comfortable over the past nine months. Rahman emphasised that despite recent turbulence, the country's fundamentals remain strong and resilient. He stressed the importance of signalling confidence to the international community and said measures are in place to protect foreign exchange reserves and manage external pressures effectively, positioning Bangladesh for continued recovery. Upon reviewing the economic growth scenario, Zaidi Sattar, chairman of PRI, pointed out that in the current year, macroeconomic stability has been restored, and the economy is poised to return to a higher growth trajectory. ""Our export potential is hobbled by a highly protective tariff regime that creates a persistent anti-export bias in policy incentives,"" he added. Clinton Pobke, deputy head of mission at the Australian High Commission in Bangladesh, emphasised Australia's commitment to strengthening economic engagement with Bangladesh through a multi-pronged approach encompassing policy reform, trade and investment, and support for public policy discourse. Speaking at the launch of the new initiative in collaboration with the PRI, Pobke expressed his appreciation for the quality of economic analysis presented. Outlining Australia's three-track strategy, Pobke explained, ""One track focuses on support for policy reform, another on enhancing bilateral trade and investment, and the third on strengthening the policy debate space in Bangladesh."" On trade and investment, Pobke highlighted a recent milestone. ""In February, we appointed our first Australian Trade and Investment Commissioner based in Dhaka -- a major step forward."" He also announced the upcoming ""Bangladesh-Australia Business Expo 2025"" in Sydney, where he hopes to see strong bilateral participation. Shams Mahmud, president of the Bangladesh-Thai Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that businesses are currently operating primarily for the benefit of banks and the NBR, while entrepreneurs themselves are struggling to make profits. Despite positive export figures, he said the business environment remains unfavourable due to persistent inflation and elevated bank interest rates.","Fri May 16, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 01:35 PM"

In response to a question about why mobile operators have not yet lowered internet prices, Taiyeb said that bandwidth prices at the gateway and transmission levels have already been reduced. ""We have already taken necessary regulatory and practical steps to ensure mobile operators reduce internet charges. Stakeholders have participated in this process. Those who haven't should get involved,"" he said. ""Since we have reduced prices at the gateway and transmission levels, we deserve internet prices to decrease at the user level."" Calling on mobile companies to cooperate, he warned that if they fail to respond, the government would bring unresolved financial issues and key performance indicators (KPIs) to the negotiation table. ""If they don't cooperate, we will raise pending dues and performance metrics in bilateral talks,"" he added. ""We do not want to block anyone's path,"" Taiyeb emphasised. ""But we want to reach a point, through dialogue with stakeholders, where citizens can access quality internet at an affordable price. We will remain steadfast for that.""

However, he said prices cannot be brought down overnight as it depends on the entire industry, not just on one agency. He added that the BTRC wants to deregulate the internet sector so that the market can determine prices and ensure diversity. Addressing the 40-minute disruption in Grameenphone's 4G services on Wednesday, the BTRC chairman said the commission has officially sought an explanation from the operator.

Now, the private sector needs to improve firm-level competitiveness to sustain a competitive market, Ferdaus Ara Begum​, chief executive officer of the Business Initiative Leading Development, said while making a presentation at a seminar. The seminar, styled ""LDC Graduation Strategies and Readiness of Private Sector"", was held at the Holiday Inn Hotel in the capital's Tejgaon, jointly organised by the Bangladesh Plastics Goods Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BPGMEA) and the Business Promotion Council under the Ministry of Commerce. Compliance with international regulations, including labour standards, is essential, she said, adding that adopting environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards would help integrate into the global value chain and attract foreign investment. She further said ensuring product quality in the local market can boost exports and that more research and development to foster innovation is crucial. Finally, Begum urged the private sector to assist the government in trade negotiations by providing necessary information. Shamim Ahmed, president of the BPGMEA, said they are quite anxious about LDC graduation. ""We don't know what the coming days will bring,"" he said. ""However, whatever the situation may be, we will have to face it. I believe that no matter what challenges arise, we will be able to overcome them."" He explained that graduating from LDC status would pose a significant challenge for Bangladesh as incentives such as duty-free facilities and Generalized System of Preferences will no longer apply, meaning the country will have to compete in the global arena on its own. To rise to this challenge, preparations must begin immediately, he said. ""We need to focus on producing quality products, exploring new export markets, and taking necessary steps to manufacture and export innovative technologies and diversified products that align with the evolving demands of foreign buyers,"" he added. Abdur Rahim Khan, an additional secretary to the Ministry of Commerce, said many businesspeople are quite anxious about LDC graduation. But he believes there is no reason to be alarmed. ""It should be viewed like this: there's a river ahead that needs to be crossed. As long as one doesn't start swimming, the task will seem difficult,"" he said. Mahbubur Rahman, secretary to the Ministry of Commerce, said Bangladesh's apparel sector has secured a better position in export diversification on its own merits. However, other major sectors with similar potential have not shown the same level of advancement, he said, adding that the plastic market is larger than the apparel market globally. ""Although we are not specialised in producing high-end plastic products, we do have a presence in the low-end segment. Despite this, the expected level of diversification in the low-end plastic segment has not been achieved,"" he added. However, Rahman also said export diversification is possible in Bangladesh through the plastic sector.","Thu May 15, 2025 09:35 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 09:34 PM"

"Business","https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/nbr-moves-speed-auction-abandoned-goods-3895556","NBR moves to speed up auction of abandoned goods","The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has issued a special order to speed up the auction process for abandoned imported goods at all sea and land ports across the country. The order, issued on Wednesday, allows not only the sale of goods through e-auction and spot auction, but also permits direct sale or transfer of items outside the auction process under specific conditions. Additionally, the order provides a provision for hazardous materials to be either sold at an offered price or transferred free of cost to authorised institutions. There is no requirement to set a reserve price for the lots, but legal verification is mandatory. Currently, customs procedures discourage the sale of non-perishable goods below their reserve value, which is 60 percent of the import price plus tax, in the first auction. Setting the reserve value at 60 percent has created significant complications in completing auctions, often resulting in repeated auction attempts without successful sales. As a consequence, several lakh tonnes of auctionable goods remain stockpiled at 25 sea and land ports across the country, including Chattogram port. According to Chattogram port and NBR sources, around two lakh tonnes of imported goods, stored in 9,644 containers, were left abandoned at the port over 11 years, between 2013 and 2024. The amount of abandoned goods will be at least double that figure if the data from the other 24 sea and land ports are considered, the sources said. Importers tend to abandon consignments due to a fall in local market prices of the goods, failure to submit original documents supporting the shipment and clearance permit reports, or refusal to pay fines for anomalies, according to customs officials and importers. NBR officials said the order streamlines the disposal process for auctionable goods with specific provisions for both e-auction and non-auction-based methods. The order also mentions that the authorities must ensure proper documentation and verification of any pending legal disputes before proceeding with the sale. The process mandates that chemical testing or policy compliance conditions must be clearly mentioned against relevant lots in the auction catalogue. The order also allows certain goods to be disposed of without auction, particularly in the case of urgent or perishable items, including sugar, lentils, and soybean oil, which can be sold to the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) at their offered rates. If items remain unsold after two auctions or fail to attract any bids, they can be offered publicly via notice and sold to interested institutions at the highest offered price. Additionally, expired but potentially usable hazardous chemicals may be sold to certified users, provided testing authorities confirm their usability, according to the order. ""The order helps to speed up the auction process and save huge amounts of goods from damage,"" Md Sakib Hossain, assistant commissioner of Chattogram Custom House, told The Daily Star. He said: ""The undelivered goods are not only occupying huge space at the port, but the customs authorities have also been deprived of revenue, while the respective shipping agents are incurring losses as they fail to get rents for those containers from the importers.""","Thu May 15, 2025 09:16 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 10:28 PM"

The other two demands are the public disclosure of a state advisory committee's report on reforms for the NBR, which was submitted to the finance ministry, and inclusive, consultative and sustainable reforms for the revenue administration. They made the announcement at a press briefing at the NBR's headquarters following a three-hour work abstention throughout the country for a second consecutive day. However, as before, international passenger services, export activities, and preparations for the national budget remained outside the purview of the strike. ""We want a comprehensive, inclusive, and sustainable reform of the revenue system, based on open discussion on the advisory report,"" said Sefat-E-Mariam, additional commissioner of the NBR, at the press conference. ""…and a white paper on the country's economic situation, engaging stakeholders, business associations, civil society, political leadership, and all relevant parties. ""We are not opposed to reforming the NBR. Officers and employees at all levels of the NBR have long been advocating for reforms in the revenue system,"" she said. ""What we want is for these reforms to be rational and widely acceptable, reflecting the national interest and a development-oriented philosophy,"" Mariam said. The revenue administration should become more effective, progressive, and free of corruption, and the reform process must not be used as a tool to serve the vested interests of any particular group, she added. She also raised questions over the advisory committee's recommendations not being made public. ""A special advisory committee was formed to split the NBR into two divisions, but unlike other reform reports published online, this committee's report was neither made public nor shared with the NBR,"" she said. Key stakeholders, like the NBR, were kept completely in the dark. The government hastily dissolved the committee without publishing the report or holding consultations, raising suspicion, she said. At the briefing, Mostafizur Rahman, deputy commissioner of the NBR, and Nipun Chakma, deputy commissioner, were present. The NBR staff, under the banner of ""NBR Reform Unity Council"", announced the strike last Tuesday after the government issued the new ordinance the night before. In the new ordinance, the government announced that it had decided to dissolve the NBR and Internal Resources Division, replacing them with a Revenue Policy Division and a Revenue Implementation Division. Both will run under the Ministry of Finance. According to the ordinance, the policy division will be responsible for formulating tax policies and setting tariffs, while the implementation division will oversee tax collection and enforcement of related rules and regulations. Protesters within the customs and income tax cadres argue that the ordinance sidelined experienced tax professionals by transferring policymaking powers to officials from the general administration and other cadres. Meanwhile, the NBR's public relations officer announced that NBR Chairman Abdur Rahman Khan would hold a press conference in front of the NBR headquarters in the afternoon yesterday. However, no briefing took place. Moreover, two groups of people, who admitted that they were neither officials nor staff of the NBR, staged demonstrations before the headquarters under the banners ""Anti-fascist People"" and ""People's Rights Party"". One group demanded the resignation of the NBR chairman, while the other group came to voice their opposition against it.","Thu May 15, 2025 08:32 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 08:46 PM"

The defeat leaves Miami in sixth place in the MLS Eastern Conference, and their form has been troubling since their Concacaf Champions Cup semifinal first leg against the Vancouver Whitecaps on April 24. In that span, they've leaked 20 goals — a stark contrast to their promising start to the season. ""[We need to] keep going. It's a complicated time,"" Messi said in a post-match interview with Apple TV. ""But we'll all stay united. We're a team in difficult times, because when everyone wins, it's easy, but now that difficult times are coming, that's when we have to be more united than ever, be a true team, and move forward, because we have what it takes."" He added: ""Think about what's next and prepare for the next game."" Miami's last win came on May 3 with a convincing 4-1 victory over the New York Red Bulls. Since then, they've drawn once and suffered two defeats, a slide that has raised questions around their consistency. ""We're coming off a period of bad results,"" Messi acknowledged. ""But we have to keep working and think about what's next. With three or four games left in May, we [have to] finish the best possible way to be able to face the Club World Cup."" Head coach Javier Mascherano echoed Messi's sentiments in his post-match press conference, calling for collective responsibility and defending his players. ""When you are in this dynamic, if we each start pulling ourselves to the side it'll be impossible to overcome the moment,"" Mascherano said. ""It's clear that we must overcome this all together because clearly this team has shown, especially at the beginning of the season, what they are capable of."" Mascherano shouldered the blame for the team's recent struggles, saying, ""I take full responsibility. I will not point out any players publicly, I am not that way. No one enters the pitch trying to have a bad time or to suffer."" The Argentine coach admitted his side attempted a risky tactical approach to counter Orlando's strengths, but key errors cost them on the night. Despite the slump, Mascherano remained optimistic earlier in the week, even hinting at a potential contract extension for Messi, whose current deal runs out at the end of the season. Inter Miami will now look to regroup ahead of their trip to Subaru Park, where they face the Philadelphia Union on Saturday.

Barring Parvez Hossain Emon's ton, Bangladesh batters did not have the impact they should have had on a batting-friendly surface in the first match of the two-match series which Bangladesh won by 27 runs. The Tigers need to address their batting-order issues as Mahedi Hasan came in front of Jaker Ali and Shamim Hossain. Neither of the three batters contributed anything significant to the score and thus having reached 103 in the first 10 overs, Bangladesh could only manage 191 for seven in the end, thanks to Emon's 54-ball 100. ""Definitely, it was a good total. The wicket was very good for batting and the way Emon batted was outstanding. But we have to finish better. We couldn't score much in the last three overs,"" Liton said after the match. The bowlers, too, found it difficult to contain UAE at the beginning, and at one point of the chase the hosts had found themselves in the driving seat before the bowlers produced key wickets to grab the win. ""I always know my bowlers can bounce back at any time. I trust our bowling unit,"" Liton said. ""That said, credit to the UAE batters as well. They batted very well in the middle overs and we need to learn from this -- to understand what kind of bowling works on this pitch. The way all the bowlers bowled and showed composure was impressive. It looked 50-50 in the middle overs, but they pulled it back brilliantly,"" he added. Mustafizur Rahman was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers, getting in crucial overs in the middle and finishing with two wickets for 17 runs. With Mustafizur departing for his IPL stint and unavailable for the second T20I, the bowling department would have to find answers. In particular, Mahedi Hasan's spells were the most expensive and a remedy in the Powerplay phase might be needed in case Bangladesh's plans with Mahedi do not work in the Powerplay. For Emon, the match would go a long way to bolstering his confidence in this T20I outfit, having become just the second Bangladesh batter after Tamim Iqbal to notch a T20I ton. Having played to his strength, Emon would look to keep the momentum going but the other batters have their work cut out to produce a meaningful score after a disappointing first game in the UAE.","Mon May 19, 2025 10:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 10:00 AM"

Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard added: ""We can be very proud of what we have done this season, especially in the Champions League. But we have not been good enough in the league.

Magpies boss Eddie Howe is uncertain if the Sweden striker will be available to face Everton at St James' Park in their vital last game on May 25. ""That is unknown. He only felt pain after training. He want for a scan this morning, more as a precaution, but it became obvious he would be fit to play,"" Howe said. ""A lot will depend on how he reacts in the next couple of days."" Third-placed Newcastle's Champions League fate remains in their hands, but they will start the final day level on points with Chelsea and Aston Villa, albeit with a superior goal difference. ""We are in a strong position. This game has gone and we just have to focus on getting our game plan right for next week,"" Howe said. ""The prize is so big and everyone is fighting for it. We have worked hard to get the job done and now it is going to go to the end. ""Who knows what twists and turns there will be.

With second-placed Inter Milan also playing out a 2-2 draw against Lazio in a simultaneous kickoff, Napoli will head into their final match against Cagliari with a one-point advantage. A win for Napoli on Sunday would have secured them the title if Inter had lost to Lazio. Napoli's best chance to break the deadlock came just after the half-hour mark, when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's volley struck the post. Matteo Politano nearly put Napoli ahead in the second half as his cross grazed the top of the crossbar, while Scott McTominay's free kick was brilliantly saved by Parma keeper Zion Suzuki. News broke in the 90th minute that Lazio had equalised against Inter, putting Napoli back in control of the title race. But as Napoli pushed desperately for a winning goal, emotions boiled over and their manager Antonio Conte and his Parma counterpart Cristian Chivu were both shown red cards after an apparent heated exchange on the touch-line. Due to the red card, Conte will be in the stands for the final match of the season. LAST MINUTE DRAMA As the match drew to a close, Napoli fans erupted in loud celebration upon hearing that Pedro had equalised for Lazio, snatching two points from Inter, with their cheers rising deep into stoppage time when David Neres was brought down by Parma's Mathias Fjortoft Lovik, with the referee initially awarding a penalty. However, after a lengthy VAR review, the decision was overturned due to an earlier foul from Napoli in the buildup. After the match, Napoli keeper Alex Meret admitted that emotions ran high in the final minutes as the situation rapidly shifted from one event to another. ""The last minutes were a rollercoaster, I saw the bench with sad faces, then luckily Lazio equalised and we tried until the end to take the lead,"" he told reporters. ""We know how to endure and fight, and we must remember where we started from, which should fill us with pride."" Napoli will host Cagliari while Inter will travel to in-form Como in the title-deciding final round next Sunday. If the two teams end up with equal points, the title will be decided by a playoff. ""There are tough opponents, like Inter, who are having an excellent season, but we must give ourselves credit and we have been good at not giving up. Now there is one last match to face, and we will be ready,"" Meret said.","Mon May 19, 2025 10:31 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 10:35 AM"

Alcaraz fended off two set points late in the first set and then seized control in the tie-break before pulling away for a 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 win, his fourth in a row over world number one Sinner. The Spaniard snapped Sinner's 26-match winning run to claim his first Rome crown and seventh Masters 1000 title, denying Italy its first male champion at the tournament since Adriano Panatta in 1976. Alcaraz was also the last player to beat Sinner, in last year's China Open final. Sunday's showdown could well be a prelude to the French Open final, with Sinner and Alcaraz set to be kept apart in the draw as the latter will return to second in the rankings on Monday. Alcaraz, who beat Sinner in a five-set semi-final en route to the Roland Garros trophy 12 months ago, has few doubts the Italian will again be a major contender in the French capital. ""The level he has played in this tournament is insane after three months without playing, without any tournament,"" said Alcaraz. ""I mean, what he has done, it's amazing. I mean, it's something that I have to have respect on that. ""I'm pretty sure he's going to be better and better. This week of practising, he's going to feel better. If he's winning in Roland Garros and he's going farther, I think much better he's going to feel. ""He's going to be a really dangerous player in Paris."" Alcaraz won his third title of the season after eventually dominating Sinner and silencing the over 10,000 fans packed into the centre court stands at the Foro Italico. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a clear message that he is near the top of his game going into the year's second Grand Slam. ""Beating Jannik and winning in Rome, I think both things mixed together give you a great confidence coming to Paris,"" said Alcaraz. ""He's (one of) the best players in the world. It doesn't matter that he was out of the tour for three months. Every tournament he's playing, he plays great. The numbers are there. He wins almost every match he plays. ""That's why I'm even more focused when I play against him. If I don't play at my best, 10 out of 10, it's going to be impossible to beat him."" Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles. The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open. Alcaraz won his second Masters 1000 title of the year in Rome to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona. Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental. Sinner let two set points slip in game 12 of the first set and that was the turning point in the match, with Alcaraz rattling off the first three points of the tie-break before going ahead in the match. Alcaraz then moved through the gears to win the first five games of the second set as he powered to his 19th career title -- drawing level with Sinner. Sinner's encouraging return though sets him up for another deep run at Roland Garros, despite his relative lack of match practice having not played since retaining his Australian Open crown in January before arriving in Rome. ""Talking (in) general, (I'm) very happy about this tournament. It gives me then hopefully confidence to play some good tennis also in Paris,"" said Sinner. ""After three months coming here making this result means a lot to me. ""For sure there are some things like we saw today what we have to improve if we want to do good in Paris. I am closer than expected in a way of everything.""","Mon May 19, 2025 09:46 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 09:51 AM"

While the result had little impact on the La Liga standings—with Barcelona already crowned champions—the England international stressed that there's still plenty to play for. With the domestic title out of reach, Bellingham and Real Madrid have now set their sights on international silverware. ""The Club World Cup is another title and I hope we win it. It's the club and the team's dream,"" said the 20-year-old. FIFA's new premier club competition—the FIFA Club World Cup 2025—will debut on the global stage in June and July, with 32 of the world's leading teams gathering in the USA for the inaugural edition. Speaking to Real Madrid TV after the game, Bellingham added: ""We're happy with the win, but a bit sad because we wanted to fight for the title in these last few games."" Despite being depleted by the absence of regular starters Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo, Madrid capitalised on their numerical advantage after Loic Bade was sent off just 11 minutes in for denying a clear scoring opportunity.  Sevilla's woes deepened shortly after halftime when substitute Isaac Romero was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Aurélien Tchouameni. Kylian Mbappe eventually broke the deadlock in the 75th minute with a precise low strike from outside the area. Just five minutes later, the Frenchman turned provider as 21-year-old academy product Gonzalo García crossed for Bellingham to tap in Madrid's second. Reflecting on his goal, Bellingham said: ""It was a good move between the two youngsters and I was there to score an easy goal."" He also praised Mbappe, who is now La Liga's top scorer with 29 goals: ""He's unbelievable. He's a very good player and a good person. It's great to have him in our team."" Real Madrid, who sit second in La Liga with one game remaining, will look to end the season on a high before turning their attention to the global stage—a chance to close the campaign with another piece of silverware.

After a six-month hiatus, the 37-year-old, playing for Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), registered a golden duck and went wicketless in a crucial clash against Peshawar Zalmi at Rawalpindi Stadium on Sunday. Shakib's last outing for the Tigers was in a Test for Bangladesh against India in Kanpur in September last week. The cricketer, however, has featured for Bangla Tigers in Abu Dhabi T10 competition since that Test. Despite Shakib's flat performance, Lahore emerged victorious, securing a 26-run win to confirm their place in the playoffs. With 11 points from 10 matches, Lahore finished fourth in the standings and will now face off in the Eliminator. Peshawar Zalmi, on the other hand, were eliminated after finishing with just 8 points. Shakib's return to action was delayed by inclement weather in Rawalpindi. A dust storm followed by thunderstorms forced a delay, reducing the match to 13 overs per side. After winning the toss, Peshawar chose to bowl first. Lahore posted 149 for eight, with opener Fakhar Zaman leading the charge, scoring a 36-ball 60. Fellow opener Mohammad Naeem added 22 from 10 balls. Shakib came in to bat in the 11th over but was dismissed on the very first ball, bowled by pacer Ahmed Daniyal. Shakib, attempting a ramp towards fine leg, was undone by a slower delivery, marking the first duck of his 15-match PSL career. This also marked the 31st duck in his 445-match T20 career. With the ball, Shakib had a solid start, conceding just five runs in his first over. However, he was unable to capitalise in his second spell, as Daniyal hit him for two consecutive sixes, leaving Shakib wicketless for 18 runs in his 2 overs. Peshawar's chase faltered as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Despite some late resistance from Daniel Sams, who scored 26 runs off 14 balls, and Daniyal's 24 off 14 balls, Peshawar were restricted to 123 for eight.","Mon May 19, 2025 02:51 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 03:15 AM"

The Fizz, playing in his first match, however, emerged as the most economical bowler for Delhi as his three overs went for just 24 runs. The win booked a playoff spot for league-leaders Gujarat who have 18 points from 12 matches, courtesy of nine wins. Gujarat's victory also ensured a spot in the play-offs for Royal Challengers Bengaluru as well as Punjab Kings, who earlier in the day won their match against Rajasthan Royals. Impact substitute Sai Sudharsan (108), who struck his second IPL century, and skipper Shubhman Gill (unbeaten 93) allowed Gujarat to chase down a target of 200 with one over to spare. Delhi, five-time champions Mumbai Indians and Lucknow Super Giants are the three teams remaining in the hunt for one play-off spot. The huge partnership between Gill and Sudharsan trumped KL Rahul's unbeaten 112 that steered the home team to 199-3 on a batting-friendly pitch. Sudharsan came out attacking as he raced to 25 off nine balls and reached his fifty with a boundary. Gill soon changed gears as he took on Sri Lanka's Dushmantha Chameera in a 19-run 13th over, with Sudharsan picking up the pace as well and completing his hundred before hitting the winning six. Earlier Rahul, who was promoted to open the innings, struck 14 fours and four sixes en route to his fifth career IPL ton. The senior India batter put on key stands including 90 runs with Abishek Porel, who made 30 off 19 balls after Delhi lost Faf du Plessis, for five. Delhi skipper Axar Patel fell for 25 but Rahul stood firm to reach his hundred, soaking up the applause from an appreciative home crowd.

Interestingly, the 28-year-old had gone unsold in this year's IPL auction despite a base price of Rs 2 crores. However, following the exit of several overseas players amid rising political tensions between India and Pakistan, Delhi picked up Mustafizur for Rs 6 crores to bolster their pace attack for the remainder of the tournament. The IPL governing body confirmed Mustafizur's addition to the Delhi squad in a press release issued last Wednesday. At the time, the pacer was on national duty with Bangladesh in the UAE. Although there were initial doubts over the availability of a no-objection certificate (NOC), the BCB cleared the way by issuing one on Friday. The NOC allows Mustafizur to participate in the IPL for one week -- from Sunday, May 18 to Saturday, May 24.

Bangladesh went on to win the match by 27 runs. The 21-year-old's innings was not only the fastest T20I century by a Bangladeshi — eclipsing Tamim Iqbal's 60-ball ton against Oman in 2016 — but also one of deep personal significance. ""Yes! I remember Tamim bhai's hundred. It was against Oman — he was hitting so well. I always watch all his matches, so that one stayed in my memory,"" Emon said after the match, reminiscing about his idol's milestone knock in the 2016 T20 World Cup. ""Alhamdulillah, it feels good to have scored a century today. After coming back to the dressing room, I remembered that Tamim bhai made the first hundred. So mine is the second. Overall, it feels really good. I've been following Tamim bhai since childhood, used to watch his games. I enjoyed it a lot. My name came after his, so Alhamdulillah, it felt really special."" Emon's knock was a blend of composure and brute force. He struck nine sixes and five fours, setting a new record for the most sixes by a Bangladeshi in a T20I innings — surpassing Rishad Hossain's seven maximums against Sri Lanka last year. Bangladesh as a team also hit 13 sixes, the most they've ever managed in a T20I innings, breaking their previous best of 12 against Sri Lanka during the Nidahas Trophy in 2018. There was a moment of anxiety when Emon, batting on 84, was caught off Matiullah Khan — but he was saved by a no-ball. He made the most of the reprieve and reached his century in just 53 balls, seven faster than Tamim's. Emon was eventually bowled in the final over by Muhammad Jawadullah after scoring exactly 100, but by then, he had done the damage. UAE finished on 164 for nine in reply, as Bangladesh sealed the match by 27 runs. ""When wickets were falling, I tried not to change my intent. I was waiting for opportunities in my strong areas. I also had it in mind that I needed to play a big innings. Since wickets were falling from the other end, I had to carry the innings. I tried to do that. Alhamdulillah, I was able to do it till the end."" From idolising Tamim Iqbal to now joining him in Bangladesh's T20I century-makers list, Emon marked a personal milestone in Sharjah — a knock that may well signal the beginning of a promising chapter in his international career.

Now, another name is quietly entering the conversation: Rakibul Hasan. Known primarily for his left-arm spin, Rakibul is beginning to showcase the kind of all-round ability that could one day earn him a similar status. His recent match-winning performances with both bat and ball in the emerging team suggest that Bangladesh may have found a new dual-threat talent in the making. While his bowling credentials were already well established, having made more than an impression in the recent Dhaka Premier League (DPL), where he finished as the joint highest wicket-taker with 30 wickets alongside his Abahani Limited team-mate Mosaddek Hossain. But little was known about his ability with the bat, which finally came to light during the emerging team's three-match one-day series against South Africa, where he played two crucial innings of 24 not out and 42, both contributing to his side's victories in Rajshahi. ""I think playing in the DPL really helped me a lot. I'm happy to contribute to the team's victories,"" Rakibul told The Daily Star yesterday, as his side reached Chattogram from Rajshahi to play the opening four-day match of a two-match series against the same opponents. In the series opener, Rakibul walked in with Bangladesh at 263 for seven, chasing 302. He smashed 24 off just 10 balls, including three sixes, sealing the win with two deliveries to spare. Rested for the second game to allow squad rotation, Rakibul returned for the decider and once again made an impact. This time, the home team were in deeper trouble at 118 for eight. His 40-ball 42, in an 84-run partnership with Mahfuzur Rahman Rabby, helped the hosts post 225 -- a total that proved more than enough. He followed up his rescue act with the bat by taking four for 26 in 10 overs, helping secure a 34-run victory and the series, ending with five wickets at an economy of 3.25. Rakibul acknowledged that his work with High Performance batting coach Rajin Saleh had paid off, and that he is ""not worried"" about getting a national team call-up yet; even though many of his 2020 U-19 World Cup-winning team-mates have already made the step up. Rajin, however, sees Rakibul as a potential all-round option for the senior side. ""Rakibul worked with me last year in the HP unit,"" the former Bangladesh player informed. ""With the maturity and experience he has now, if he works on a few areas and performs consistently well, he has the potential to serve Bangladesh as a quality all-rounder.""

""The wicket looked good to bat on. I thought the way Emon played was really amazing to watch,"" said Liton during post-match presentation ceremony. Emon smashed a blistering 54-ball 100 — the fastest T20I century by a Bangladeshi.  Powered by Emon's knock, the Tigers posted 191 for seven, their total bolstered by a record 13 sixes in the innings. Despite the commanding total, Bangladesh had to weather a spirited chase from the hosts. UAE skipper Muhammad Waseem (54 off 39) and Rahul Chopra (35 off 22) kept their side in the hunt with a 62-run third-wicket stand. Later, Asif Khan threatened to snatch the game with a fiery 21-ball 42, featuring three successive sixes off Mahedi Hasan. Reflecting on the match, Litton acknowledged the Tigers' shortcomings in the death overs and with the ball. ""We have to finish well, because in the last three wickets we could not score that much. I know my bowlers, anytime they can come back. But at the same time, the UAE batters played really well. Credit goes to them for the way they batted in the middle overs,"" he said. ""We have to focus on our bowling as well. We have to learn this wicket and the ground, like what ball should suit this ground."" Still, there were bright spots with the ball. Hasan Mahmud claimed 3 for 33 and was instrumental in closing out the game by dismissing the dangerous Asif in the penultimate over. Mustafizur Rahman was particularly tidy, conceding just 17 runs and picking up two wickets in his four-over spell. ""Definitely the confidence. The way everyone bowled and the calmness. In the middle, it looked a bit 50-50, but the way all the bowlers bowled in the middle, it was amazing,"" Liton added. The Tigers were also lifted by passionate support in the stands. ""Whenever we play, our supporters come and enjoy watching the game. Their support is really amazing too.""

Elsewhere Kylian Mbappe struck as Real Madrid won 2-0 at nine-man Sevilla, while Leganes gave themselves a chance of survival with a win at Las Palmas. Barcelona stars celebrated their 28th league title on an open-top bus on Friday but Hansi Flick warned that ""those who party, can work"" and selected a strong side. However the visitors took the lead through in-form striker Ayoze Perez, who slotted past Marc-Andre ter Stegen after Nicolas Pepe set him up. Lamine Yamal, who scored a vital goal as Barca clinched the league on Thursday at Espanyol, scored another stunner to level. The 17-year-old breezed past two defenders and arrowed a shot into the far bottom corner. Yamal hit the bar before Fermin Lopez sent Barca ahead, walloping home from the edge of the box. Santi Comesana lofted over Ter Stegen to equalise for the visitors, who nosed in front through Tajon Buchanan in the 80th minute. Barca fell to their first home defeat of 2025 and also their first league reverse this year, but chants of ""champions"" rang around the Olympic stadium, on potentially the team's last game there before a return to the renovated Camp Nou next season. The domestic treble winners were presented with the league trophy at the end of the game. Villarreal booked their return to Europe's top competition as they opened up a big gap on Real Betis, sixth, as they were thrashed 4-1 at Atletico Madrid. Julian Alvarez scored two and created another as Diego Simeone's side, third, ran out comfortable winners. French superstar Mbappe netted his 29th league goal of the season to help Real Madrid to a narrow win over nine-man Sevilla in coach Carlo Ancelotti's penultimate match at the helm. Loic Bade's 12th minute red card for a professional foul on Mbappe set back the hosts, and then Isaac Romero was dismissed at the start of the second half for a high tackle on Aurelien Tchouameni. Eventually the division's top scorer Mbappe drilled home Madrid's opener from range and Jude Bellingham nabbed a second from close range late on. At the bottom of the table Leganes took their fight for survival to the last day of the season with a 1-0 win at downed Las Palmas, thanks to Dani Raba's early strike. The Madrid minnows, 18th, are two points from safety and face relegated Real Valladolid in their last game. Espanyol's 2-0 defeat by Osasuna leaves them in danger of the drop and the Catalan side, 17th, welcome Las Palmas next weekend knowing a win would keep them up.","Mon May 19, 2025 01:31 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 01:43 AM"

Rice's brilliant second half strike at the Emirates Stadium guaranteed Arsenal will compete in Europe's elite club competition next season. Mikel Arteta's side ended a five-game winless streak to avoid a nervous last day of the season next weekend, with the battle for top five places no longer a concern for the Gunners. Second-placed Arsenal are likely to finish as Premier League runners-up for a third successive season after failing to keep pace with champions Liverpool. The north Londoners, who lost in the Champions League semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain, have now gone five years without a trophy. Despite another season of frustration for Arsenal, they still look the most likely challengers for Liverpool's crown next term. In a pointed message to Arsenal's transfer chiefs after their failure to sign a striker in January, Arteta said: ""Finish the season, go to the beach and make sure the ones upstairs do what they have to do. ""Our dream needs to not get blurry. What we have done to sustain the level this season with everything that has happened (with injuries) is incredible."" Third-placed Newcastle are above fourth-placed Chelsea and fifth-placed Aston Villa on goal difference. Sixth-placed Manchester City would go above Eddie Howe's team if they avoid defeat in their game in hand at home to Bournemouth on Tuesday. Nottingham Forest, in seventh place, are only one point behind League Cup winners Newcastle in a remarkably close race to reach the Champions League. Newcastle will have to beat Everton at St James' Park in their last game of the season on May 25 to seal qualification. ""It was one of our strongest away performances but you have to score and we didn't. Only got ourselves to blame for that,"" Howe said. ""You want it to be in your own hands. We back ourselves at home and under pressure but there will be all the build-up to the game."" The Magpies had beaten Arsenal three times this season, but they were without injured leading scorer Alexander Isak and the Swede's absence proved costly. Bruno Guimaraes' close-range strike was parried by David Raya after the Arsenal keeper's miscued pass to Sandro Tonali had started the Newcastle attack. Rice rocket  Raya was called into action again to save Tino Livramento's drive after Anthony Gordon's backheel opened up the Arsenal defence. Raya was at full stretch to push away Harvey Barnes' low drive from the edge of the area. The over-worked Arsenal keeper made another fine save to repel Dan Burn's header before using his foot while still on the ground to keep out Sven Botman's follow-up. Arteta lacked any rhythm and Arteta threw his arms up in frustration after another sloppy move broke down late in the first half. French defender William Saliba was replaced by Riccardo Calafiori at half-time in an injury blow for the Gunners. But Arsenal finally shook off their lethargy to take the lead in the 55th minute. Martin Odegaard worked space for a pass to Rice and the midfielder lashed a superb first-time finish past Pope from the edge of the area. Rice's ninth goal in all competitions this season was almost followed by one for Saka, whose shot was blocked by Pope. Arsenal had seized the momentum and Ben White tried to emulate Rice with a stinging 20-yard strike that whistled just wide. Newcastle's frustration was mounting and Emil Krafth was booked for a needless foul just 33 seconds after coming off the bench. Kai Havertz replaced Saka in the last 15 minutes for his first appearance since February after a hamstring injury. Havertz was involved in an immediate clash with Burn, who threw the ball at the German. Newcastle's Joe Willock blasted just over as Arsenal held on in a nerve-jangling climax.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:36 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 12:40 AM"

Bangladesh captain Nazmul Huda Faisal blew his shot over the bar before Salah Uddin Shahed saw his shot saved by the opposition keeper after goalkeeper Ismail Hossain Mahin had handed the boys in red and green the advantage with a save from the first shot. Earlier, it was Mahin's howler which had given India a second-minute lead of the thrilling final, the goalkeeper backpaddling casually to a freekick from India captain Singamayum Shami, eventually watching the ball sail into the back of the net. The hosts, buoyed by a full-house crowd at the top of their voice, launched a torrent of attacks in the first 15 minutes of the match but Bangladesh soon started controlling the game with their skillful and organised football. The Bangladesh players applied heavy pressure towards the end of the first half and the persistent pressure paid off 16 minute after the break when substitute Joy Ahmed smashed home from a goalmouth melee as India failed to clear the danger.","Sun May 18, 2025 09:45 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 10:03 PM"

Alfaz Ahmed, a prolific striker of the club in its heydays, made it happen as head coach after many others had failed to do so over the last 23 years. It wasn't easy for a club which had gone through a lot of ups and downs in recent years, including the Casino Scandal and the troubles post August-5. In a conversation with The Daily Star's Atique Anam, the former national team captain spoke about the secret of his team's success and what he expects from the club in the wake of this title triumph. Following are the excerpts: The Daily Star (DS): Mohammedan had won their last league title 23 years ago. It has been a long wait. How is the feeling for you? Alfaz Ahmed (AA): It's hard to express the feeling in words. We grew up as players from Mohammedan and to take the club to a good position feels so good. It feels great to think of myself as a part of this title triumph. DS: You all must have followed the game on Youtube. How was the environment at the club tent? AA: Everyone celebrated with loud cheers and revelry after the title was secured. We all are happy to become champions. But the official celebration is yet to take place, and the club officials will decide how to celebrate this achievement. DS: You won many titles with Mohammedan as a player. But the club has gone through a dark period and had lots of ups and downs in recent years. How did you and the rest of the coaching staff bring the team to this stage? AA: Once (Imtiaz Ahmed) Nakib and I took over, alongside the football committee members, our responsibility was to bring back the glory of the club. Our chairman (Mohiuddin) Alamgir bhai and club president General Mubeen made a lot of contribution towards this achievement. On top of all, the players, both local and foreign, played a tremendous role. It was a complete teamwork. DS: Mohammedan became a force again over the last few years, winning a Federation Cup title and then making it to the final in a few other competitions recently. Did you believe, at the beginning of the season, that the club would eventually win the title this time? AA: When we finished as runners-up in three tournaments last year – Federation Cup, league and Independence Cup, we thought why not become champions if we can finish second. Our main target was to win the league title this time. We followed that objective and the players played with full effort.  DS: After the change in political landscape, Bashundhara Kings and Abahani have become a bit weak. Sheikh Jamal and Sheikh Russel were not even there. Do you think that helped your job too? AA: In sports, everyone wants to be champions. No one gives a quarter to their opponents on the pitch. There is no weak team in the Dhaka league. If you look at the results, we beat Fortis, Fortis beat Abahani, Abahani beat Bashundhara. I think the league overall was very competitive this time around. DS: Your own club, too, had gone through a lot of issues, mostly financially, this year. Did that make any impact on the pitch? AA: It was a big challenge for us. We suffered financially. However, Alamgir bhai, despite his troubles, was always with Mohammedan. He has spent a lot of money on Mohammedan over the last three-four seasons. DS: We have heard that Mohammedan owe the players and coaching staff close to theee months' salaries. How difficult has it been for you and the players to stay motivated during these times? AA: See, we have all made sacrifices on the promises of the club officials.  Everyone worked for the club with a sacrificing attitude. So it is time for the club to pay back.  You don't win championships every other day. We have brought the trophy to Mohammedan. That needs to be taken into cognizance by the club officials. We would want the club to celebrate this victory and make the players satisfied. DS: Apart from the salaries, there are other deficiencies for Mohammedan. The club doesn't have a proper tent or training ground. What would be your demand to the club in this regard? AA: We don't have a proper training ground. That is the biggest demand from us. The club needs to make sure that this success is harnessed for further success. What we have done is bring back people's love for the club. We have instilled the belief that we can now beat teams like Bashundhara Kings. There will be a new committee in place soon. So our expectation would be that the club forms a strong team to help us continue our success.

Despite splashing nearly 200 million euros in the January transfer window in a desperate bid to salvage their season, City have now fallen short on all fronts — Premier League, Champions League, and the domestic cup competitions — failing to lift a single piece of silverware for the first time since 2016-17. Eberechi Eze's early strike was enough for Palace to stun Pep Guardiola's men, who also missed a golden opportunity to equalise when Omar Marmoush saw his penalty saved by Dean Henderson in the first half. With regular taker Erling Haaland on the pitch, it came as a surprise when the Norwegian handed penalty duties to Marmoush. The Egyptian forward hesitated before his spot-kick, and Henderson dived the right way to preserve Palace's lead. City's decision raised eyebrows across the football world, with former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney questioning Haaland's mentality. ""Erling Haaland is a world-class forward, but when we're talking about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, there's no way they're giving that ball away,"" Rooney said on BBC Sport. ""That's what separates those two players — they are selfish in a good way and they want to score every game."" Rooney also suggested the pressure of Wembley may have played a part. ""Maybe the thought of taking a penalty at Wembley might have been too much for him. You never know, he's a human being."" The former England captain was also livid over a controversial moment involving Henderson earlier in the game when the Palace keeper appeared to handle the ball outside the box. ""Just get rid of VAR,"" Rooney fumed. ""They have made a mistake and now they are trying to cover up. It is a red card and everyone can see it's a red card."" City boss Pep Guardiola later revealed the penalty decision was made between the players on the pitch. ""They decided on the pitch. I don't know. I didn't speak with them,"" Guardiola said in his post-match press conference. ""That moment is how they are feeling. They decided that Omar was ready to take it. I think he took a lot of time, to put more pressure on himself, and Henderson made a good save."" Saturday's defeat marks the second successive season City have lost in the FA Cup final and caps off a bitterly disappointing campaign in which they've been dethroned as the dominant force in English football.

"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/guardiola-urges-city-turn-fa-cup-pain-top-five-push-3897256","Guardiola urges City to turn FA Cup pain into top-five push","Pep Guardiola has urged his Manchester City flops to use the pain from their shock FA Cup final defeat as fuel to salvage their dismal season by qualifying for the Champions League. Guardiola's side will finish without major silverware for the first time in eight years after crashing to a 1-0 defeat against Crystal Palace at Wembley on Saturday. Eberechi Eze's 16th-minute strike and Dean Henderson's penalty save from Omar Marmoush late in the first half condemned troubled City to the latest setback in their turbulent season. Henderson made a series of superb stops to deny City, who claimed the goalkeeper should have been sent off after handling outside his area in the first period. City's lack of cutting edge was exposed by Palace's tactically astute game-plan, leaving Guardiola to survey the wreckage of a wretched campaign that has included his team surrendering the Premier League title to Liverpool and crashing out of the Champions League. The Spaniard believes City can still partially save face by securing a top five finish in the Premier League, which guarantees a place in the Champions League next term. They are currently sixth in the table, one point outside the top five with a home game against Bournemouth on Tuesday followed by a trip to Fulham for their last match on May 25. ""We had fixed in the last month the problems we had all season with scoring and conceding. In the last period we were so stable,"" Guardiola said. ""But lately against Palace and Southampton we didn't create much. I'm not saying it is easy. We need good crosses and good people in the box. ""The game-plan didn't work because we didn't win. But I don't have any bad feeling about that. We are sad because we didn't win a beautiful competition. ""Now we must continue and recover quick for the last two finals we have to play to qualify for the Champions League."" - 'It's not easy' - It was City's second successive FA Cup final defeat after losing last year's showpiece against arch rivals Manchester United. Significantly, City striker Erling Haaland's decision to allow Marmoush to take the penalty was indicative of the Norwegian's lack of confidence at present. Haaland has failed to score in any of his six Wembley appearances for City, a barren streak including three FA Cup finals and one semi-final. The former Borussia Dortmund star, who has 30 goals in 42 games in all competitions this term, also failed to score in City's Champions League final win against Inter Milan and their UEFA Super Cup victory over Sevilla. Facing a Palace team content to sit deep and frustrate City, Haaland had few clear sights of goal. But Guardiola must find a way to improve the supply lines to his leading scorer if City are to finish in the top five. At Wembley, City repeatedly turned to Kevin De Bruyne to prise open the well-drilled Palace defence. But, playing in his last final for City before leaving in the close-season, the Belgian midfielder's inconsistent display showed why Guardiola is willing to let him go as injuries and age take their toll. ""I expect, again, in that way, I want Kevin in that position to deliver some balls. Unfortunately, we could not find him in the position that we wanted,"" he said. Guardiola is clinging to the hope that City can mount one last push, saying: ""We played much better, for example, than when we beat Palace 5-2 in April. ""We were much better than last season when we lost against United in the final. Today, we did everything. ""We had the possession to create chances, we could create more, yeah, but it's not easy, I've said that, it's not easy with 11 players there (in defence).""","Sun May 18, 2025 10:05 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 10:05 AM"

Alcaraz, who will climb to world number two behind Sinner on Monday, won his third title of the season, eventually dominating Sinner and silencing the over 10,000 fans packed into the centre court stands. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a message to the rest of the men's tour for the French Open, where he will defend the title once it starts next weekend. ""Beating Jannik and winning in Rome, I think both things mixed together give you a great confidence coming to Paris,"" said Alcaraz. ""I'm going to enjoy this moment with my family, with my team, friends that came from home. And a few days rest just to realise what I've achieved, that is important as well. And then my focus is on Roland Garros."" Sinner tops the world rankings but his 26-match winning streak was ended by Alcaraz, also the man who had last beaten him in last year's China Open final. Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles. The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open. Alcaraz won his second Masters 1000 title of the year in Rome to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona. - Alcaraz triumphs - Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental. Sinner let two set points slip in game 12 of the first set and that was the turning point in the match, with Alcaraz rattling off the first three points of the tie-break before going ahead in the match. Alcaraz then moved through the gears to win the first five games of the second set as he powered to a first Rome crown. Sinner's encouraging return though sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris. Sinner said on court that Alcaraz would be ""the man to beat"" at Paris and then jokingly thanked his brother Mark for ""preferring to go to Imola to watch the Formula One Grand Prix instead of being here"". The 23-year-old was gunning to become the first Italian man to win at the Foro Italico since Adriano Panatta back in 1976, but he failed to make it a hat-trick of triumphs for home players in the Italian capital. Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5.

Late bloomer Paolini is the first Italian woman to win the Rome event since Raffaella Reggi in 1985 after overcoming former US Open champion Gauff. Paolini delighted the packed centre court at the Foro Italico by winning the first of a potential three titles for local players at this year's event in the Italian capital. The 29-year-old is the oldest woman to win her first Rome title during the Open Era, while Gauff, eight years Paolini's junior, missed out on becoming the youngest to take the crown since Serena Williams back in 2002. Just as in her battling semi-final win over Zheng Qinwen, Gauff made 55 unforced errors to go with seven double faults on serve, making Paolini's life unnecessarily easy. Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with the world number five and Sara Errani taking on Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday.

World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico. After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches. And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month. A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976. ""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner. ""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final."" Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4). The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season. ""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win. ""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play."" Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display. And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening. ""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters. Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour. The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph. Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February. But frm nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match. It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted. Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set.

Madrid Open winner Sabalenka was sent packing in the quarterfinals by Chinese eighth-seed Zheng Qinwen 6-4, 6-3. Third seed Alcaraz, meanwhile, produced what he called one of his best displays of the season to book a last-four date with the man he beat in Monte Carlo last month. The Spaniard's impressive win over Draper kept alive his chances of a third title of the season and also moved him up to number two in the world rankings behind Jannik Sinner. ""I lost focus a little bit in the second set but it wasn't (for) too long, so it was pretty good,"" said the four-time Grand Slam winner in search of a first Rome crown. ""Probably it was one of the most complete matches that I played this year."" Alcaraz had to be at his best to down fifth seed Draper, who put in another strong showing on clay in Italy after losing the Madrid Open final to Casper Ruud. The Briton lost control of the first set when, after taking a two-game lead, he was broken twice by Alcaraz who then took the lead in the match. And Alcaraz made sure of victory by breaking Draper to love to go 5-4 ahead in the second set before serving out the match. The day's final match saw current world number two and defending champion Zverev lose his Rome crown in addition to his ranking as he went down to home hope Musetti 7-6 (7/1), 6-4. After trading breaks earlier in the set, Zverev looked set to seal the opener after breaking Musetti at 5-5 and then leading on his next service game 40-0. But the Italian improbably saved four set points to force a tiebreak, which he swept 7-1 in front of a raucous centre court. An angered Zverev argued with the umpire in the second set but kept his cool on the court until 4-4. The German had looked the more likely to make a breakthrough until the ninth game when a stunning backhand passing shot gave Musetti break point, which he duly converted before holding to 30 to reach his third semi of the year on clay. Ruud's attempt at a Madrid and Rome double has a Sinner-shaped obstacle in its way after the world number seven won his postponed match with Jaume Munar 6-3, 6-4 to reach the quarterfinals, where he will face the top seed on Thursday. Sabalenka's stunning clay-court form deserted her at the Foro Italico as she fell in straight sets to Olympic gold medallist Zheng. It was seventh time lucky for the world number eight as she at last got the better of her Belarusian opponent with a confident display under the lights in Rome. After surviving early pressure on her own serve, Zheng broke Sabalenka to take a 3-2 lead in the first set before serving out. Zheng then pounced in Sabalenka's first service game in the second frame to go up a break. Sabalenka showed determination to make gritty holds in the fifth and seventh games of the set, but she could not make inroads on Zheng's service as the 22-year-old powered into the semis. ""It's been a long time I haven't arrived in semi-finals,"" Zheng told Sky Sports after securing her first semi-final appearance of the season. ""It was not easy for me because at the beginning of the year I got some struggles with my arm. ""So right now I'm just perfectly in shape and trying to play better tennis all the time."" Zheng will meet Coco Gauff in the last four after the American earlier beat Mirra Andreeva 6-4, 7-6 (7/5). Gauff has guaranteed herself number two in the women's world rankings with her solid displays in Rome, where she saw off seventh seed Andreeva. Former US Open winner Gauff said that she had ""a lot of confidence"" for the last four, where she will face an opponent against whom she holds a 2-0 record. Gauff, 21, is looking for her first title of the season ahead of Roland Garros, after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka. Indian Wells champion Andreeva put up surprisingly little resistance in a low-key first set. And Gauff had too much for her in the second, quickly responding to each of Andreeva's breaks of serve before coming through a tricky tie-break.","Thu May 15, 2025 06:00 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 06:00 AM"

The 23-year-old Italian star only returned to the circuit last Saturday, at the Italian Open, after serving a three month doping ban. Video released by the Vatican showed Sinner shaking the hand of the Chicago-born pope and presenting him with a racquet similar to his own. With a racquet in both men's hands, Sinner then whipped out a ball. ""Do you want to play a little bit?"" asked Sinner, dressed in a black suit. Both men laughed, peering up at the gold fabric covered walls around them. ""We'd better leave it,"" joked the pope. Sinner was accompanied by members of his family and the president of the Italian Tennis Federation, Angelo Binaghi, during the visit. He also showed the pope the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup trophies won by Italy in 2024. The head of the Vatican's press office earlier said that ""the pope's passion for tennis is well known"". The 69-year-old pontiff likes not just to watch but also to play, according to reports. In an interview after being made cardinal in 2023, the former missionary in Peru said: ""I consider myself an amateur tennis player. ""Since I left Peru, I haven't had many opportunities to play, but I can't wait to get back on the court."" Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport said that according to his friends, the Augustinian ""has an excellent backhand and is a formidable competitor"". On Monday during an audience with the international press, the pope was asked by a journalist to take part in a charity tennis tournament. ""Certainly,"" replied the pope. ""I'll come with (Andre) Agassi,"" he said. ""As long as it's not Sinner,"" he joked. At a tournament press conference Monday following Sinner's third round victory over Dutchman Jesper de Jong, journalists asked Sinner what he thought about having a tennis-loving pope. ""It's great for tennis players to have a pope who follows us and who has played,"" said Sinner. Among one of the Vatican's many amenities is an outdoor clay tennis court.","Wed May 14, 2025 06:54 PM         Last update on: Wed May 14, 2025 07:00 PM"

Italian Sinner bested 17th seed Cerundolo 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 in a match which was delayed by a couple of hours due to a torrential downpour to set up a last-eight clash with either Casper Ruud or Jaume Munar. Cerundolo knocked out Sinner in the last 16 the last time he played here in 2023, but that was before the 23-year-old had became the tournament-winning machine he is today. Sinner is finding his feet in Rome, his first tournament since the end of a three-month suspension accepted in February from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) following two positive tests for traces of clostebol in March last year. His true target is the French Open which follows his home event and he showed some signs of rediscovering the form which has won him three Grand Slams and last year's ATP Finals. ""I'm very happy because today I felt that I raised my level. Game-wise I felt a little bit better,"" he said. ""I'm happy to be back. I was three months out so, you know, every situation for me I feel very fortunate to be here."" Sinner had to battle through the first set against spirited Cerundolo but once he prevailed in the tie-break he built up an unassailable lead by winning four games in a row in the second. The packed centre court stands hailed their hero after he took the win at the fourth time of asking and continue his bid for a first Rome title. - Musetti defies Medvedev, rain - The rain which delayed Sinner's match had a much bigger impact on his compatriot Lorenzo Musetti, who reached the last eight after having to wait nearly three hours at match point before he could finish off his victory over Daniil Medvedev. World number nine Musetti will face either reigning Rome champion Alexander Zverev in the last eight after seeing off Medvedev 7-5, 6-4. Musetti held his nerve to win on the first point after the long break and made sure that his first week in the top 10 of the world rankings would bring another solid run in a big tournament, after he reached the final in Monte Carlo and the last four in Madrid. Organisers later said that Musetti would have to pull out of his doubles campaign alongside Lorenzo Sonego due to an injury to his right arm. Fellow Italian Jasmine Paolini was playing on centre court at the same time as the first part of Musetti's match but managed to complete her comeback from a set down to beat Diana Shnaider 6-7 (1/7), 6-4, 6-2 just before the worst of the weather hit. Paolini is the first Italian woman to reach the Rome semi-finals since 2014, when her doubles partner Sara Errani got to the final only to be soundly beaten by Serena Williams. Alcaraz through  Earlier Carlos Alcaraz beat Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 in a hugely entertaining opening match of the day on centre court. Third seed Alcaraz had never lost a set in his previous four meetings with Khachanov but was forced to fight to get past Russia's Khachanov. The Spaniard took his 12th clay-court win of the year to set up a clash in the last eight with fifth seed Jack Draper, a winner over France's Corentin Moutet. ""It was tiring. You know the match was really tough. I had to run. I had to run a lot,"" said Alcaraz. ""I didn't play well. I just fought and I'm just really happy about it.""

Khachanov's fate looked sealed when his serve was broken in game five of the second set, but the big hitter had other ideas and immediately broke back before claiming the set. And the 28-year-old showed incredible spirit to win three games on the bounce to level the third set at 4-4, just as Alcaraz look certain to win.

"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/more-sports/tennis/news/murray-and-djokovic-end-coaching-partnership-after-six-months-3893756","Murray and Djokovic end coaching partnership after six months","Andy Murray and former rival Novak Djokovic have ended their coaching partnership after six months, the pair announced on Tuesday. Djokovic stunned the tennis world in November when he hired the retired Murray, who had no track record as a coach. But the two 37-year-olds have now parted company after a tough start to the season for the 24-time Grand Slam champion, with the French Open looming. ""Thank you, coach Andy, for all the hard work, fun and support over last six months on and off the court, really enjoyed deepening our friendship together,"" said Djokovic. Britain's Murray, born just a week before the Serb, thanked his former adversary for the chance to work with him. ""Thanks to Novak for the unbelievable opportunity to work together and thanks to his team for all their hard work over the past six months,"" Murray said in a statement. ""I wish Novak all the best for the rest of the season."" The partnership between the two former world number ones started well, with Djokovic defeating Carlos Alcaraz at the Australian Open, only to be forced to retire during his semi-final against Alexander Zverev as a result of injury. But success has since proved elusive for Djokovic, who is stuck on 99 career singles titles. He has not won a single match on clay this season, losing in the first round at Monte Carlo and Madrid. Djokovic, who turns 38 next week, pulled out of this week's Italian Open but has taken a wild card into next week's Geneva Open as he searches for form. His hopes of a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam triumph, which would take him clear of Australia women's great Margaret Court's tally of 24 singles major titles, appear to be fading. Murray admitted at the Australian Open in January he had not wanted to jump straight into coaching following his retirement last year but Djokovic's offer proved too good to refuse. Djokovic was glowing in his praise of the impact Murray had had, and it was announced in February that they would continue to work together for the hard-court events in Indian Wells and Miami and some clay-court events. It was anticipated that would include the French Open, while Murray's success at Wimbledon made that a logical choice too, but they have decided to part ways. Djokovic is a three-time French Open champion and last year won his first Olympic title on the clay of Roland Garros, beating Alcaraz in a thrilling final. But Djokovic, so used to being the alpha male of the men's game, said after defeat in Madrid last month that he was adjusting to ""a new reality"". ""Trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament... it's a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis,"" he said. Djokovic and Murray, who won three Grand Slams, including two Wimbledon titles, were part of the ""Big Four"" who dominated men's tennis along with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, both of whom have retired. They met 36 times on court, with Djokovic leading the head-to-head 25-11.","Tue May 13, 2025 06:12 PM         Last update on: Tue May 13, 2025 06:14 PM"

Declan Rice's superb second half strike from the edge of the area ended Arsenal's five-match winless run and ensured they will finish in the Premier League's top five. But while Arsenal are likely to finish as runners-up for a third consecutive campaign, few associated with the north London club believe this season has been a success. The Gunners failed to launch a serious challenge as Liverpool strolled to the title and were also eliminated in the semi-finals of both the Champions League and League Cup. Arteta's only silverware with Arsenal remains the 2020 FA Cup and his club haven't won the title for 21 years. But addressing the Emirates crowd after the final whistle against Newcastle, Arteta said: ""We had a dream, and it was to be here now, or in a week's time and bringing the big trophies to you guys but we couldn't do it for many circumstances. ""We need to make sure chasing a dream doesn't get blurry, and make sure we chase the dream with enthusiasm and positivity next season. ""We have started to create our own history here in the stadium. There is much more to come but it won't be easy. ""We have to do it together. Let me tell you, this group of players have the hunger, quality, and talent and we are going to make it happen."" Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard added: ""We can be very proud of what we have done this season, especially in the Champions League. But we have not been good enough in the league. ""We have to take all the experiences, good and bad, and come back better. And we will that pain of not winning but come back stronger and bring trophies to this club."" 'The prize is so big'  Newcastle dominated the first half but failed to take any of their chances in the absence of leading scorer Alexander Isak due to a groin injury. Magpies boss Eddie Howe is uncertain if the Sweden striker will be available to face Everton at St James' Park in their vital last game on May 25. ""That is unknown. He only felt pain after training. He want for a scan this morning, more as a precaution, but it became obvious he would be fit to play,"" Howe said. ""A lot will depend on how he reacts in the next couple of days."" Third-placed Newcastle's Champions League fate remains in their hands, but they will start the final day level on points with Chelsea and Aston Villa, albeit with a superior goal difference. ""We are in a strong position. This game has gone and we just have to focus on getting our game plan right for next week,"" Howe said. ""The prize is so big and everyone is fighting for it. We have worked hard to get the job done and now it is going to go to the end. ""Who knows what twists and turns there will be.

The defeat leaves Miami in sixth place in the MLS Eastern Conference, and their form has been troubling since their Concacaf Champions Cup semifinal first leg against the Vancouver Whitecaps on April 24. In that span, they've leaked 20 goals — a stark contrast to their promising start to the season. ""[We need to] keep going. It's a complicated time,"" Messi said in a post-match interview with Apple TV. ""But we'll all stay united. We're a team in difficult times, because when everyone wins, it's easy, but now that difficult times are coming, that's when we have to be more united than ever, be a true team, and move forward, because we have what it takes."" He added: ""Think about what's next and prepare for the next game."" Miami's last win came on May 3 with a convincing 4-1 victory over the New York Red Bulls. Since then, they've drawn once and suffered two defeats, a slide that has raised questions around their consistency. ""We're coming off a period of bad results,"" Messi acknowledged. ""But we have to keep working and think about what's next. With three or four games left in May, we [have to] finish the best possible way to be able to face the Club World Cup."" Head coach Javier Mascherano echoed Messi's sentiments in his post-match press conference, calling for collective responsibility and defending his players. ""When you are in this dynamic, if we each start pulling ourselves to the side it'll be impossible to overcome the moment,"" Mascherano said. ""It's clear that we must overcome this all together because clearly this team has shown, especially at the beginning of the season, what they are capable of."" Mascherano shouldered the blame for the team's recent struggles, saying, ""I take full responsibility. I will not point out any players publicly, I am not that way. No one enters the pitch trying to have a bad time or to suffer."" The Argentine coach admitted his side attempted a risky tactical approach to counter Orlando's strengths, but key errors cost them on the night. Despite the slump, Mascherano remained optimistic earlier in the week, even hinting at a potential contract extension for Messi, whose current deal runs out at the end of the season. Inter Miami will now look to regroup ahead of their trip to Subaru Park, where they face the Philadelphia Union on Saturday.

With second-placed Inter Milan also playing out a 2-2 draw against Lazio in a simultaneous kickoff, Napoli will head into their final match against Cagliari with a one-point advantage. A win for Napoli on Sunday would have secured them the title if Inter had lost to Lazio. Napoli's best chance to break the deadlock came just after the half-hour mark, when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's volley struck the post. Matteo Politano nearly put Napoli ahead in the second half as his cross grazed the top of the crossbar, while Scott McTominay's free kick was brilliantly saved by Parma keeper Zion Suzuki. News broke in the 90th minute that Lazio had equalised against Inter, putting Napoli back in control of the title race. But as Napoli pushed desperately for a winning goal, emotions boiled over and their manager Antonio Conte and his Parma counterpart Cristian Chivu were both shown red cards after an apparent heated exchange on the touch-line. Due to the red card, Conte will be in the stands for the final match of the season. LAST MINUTE DRAMA As the match drew to a close, Napoli fans erupted in loud celebration upon hearing that Pedro had equalised for Lazio, snatching two points from Inter, with their cheers rising deep into stoppage time when David Neres was brought down by Parma's Mathias Fjortoft Lovik, with the referee initially awarding a penalty. However, after a lengthy VAR review, the decision was overturned due to an earlier foul from Napoli in the buildup. After the match, Napoli keeper Alex Meret admitted that emotions ran high in the final minutes as the situation rapidly shifted from one event to another. ""The last minutes were a rollercoaster, I saw the bench with sad faces, then luckily Lazio equalised and we tried until the end to take the lead,"" he told reporters. ""We know how to endure and fight, and we must remember where we started from, which should fill us with pride."" Napoli will host Cagliari while Inter will travel to in-form Como in the title-deciding final round next Sunday. If the two teams end up with equal points, the title will be decided by a playoff. ""There are tough opponents, like Inter, who are having an excellent season, but we must give ourselves credit and we have been good at not giving up. Now there is one last match to face, and we will be ready,"" Meret said.","Mon May 19, 2025 10:31 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 10:35 AM"

Barring Parvez Hossain Emon's ton, Bangladesh batters did not have the impact they should have had on a batting-friendly surface in the first match of the two-match series which Bangladesh won by 27 runs. The Tigers need to address their batting-order issues as Mahedi Hasan came in front of Jaker Ali and Shamim Hossain. Neither of the three batters contributed anything significant to the score and thus having reached 103 in the first 10 overs, Bangladesh could only manage 191 for seven in the end, thanks to Emon's 54-ball 100. ""Definitely, it was a good total. The wicket was very good for batting and the way Emon batted was outstanding. But we have to finish better. We couldn't score much in the last three overs,"" Liton said after the match. The bowlers, too, found it difficult to contain UAE at the beginning, and at one point of the chase the hosts had found themselves in the driving seat before the bowlers produced key wickets to grab the win. ""I always know my bowlers can bounce back at any time. I trust our bowling unit,"" Liton said. ""That said, credit to the UAE batters as well. They batted very well in the middle overs and we need to learn from this -- to understand what kind of bowling works on this pitch. The way all the bowlers bowled and showed composure was impressive. It looked 50-50 in the middle overs, but they pulled it back brilliantly,"" he added. Mustafizur Rahman was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers, getting in crucial overs in the middle and finishing with two wickets for 17 runs. With Mustafizur departing for his IPL stint and unavailable for the second T20I, the bowling department would have to find answers. In particular, Mahedi Hasan's spells were the most expensive and a remedy in the Powerplay phase might be needed in case Bangladesh's plans with Mahedi do not work in the Powerplay. For Emon, the match would go a long way to bolstering his confidence in this T20I outfit, having become just the second Bangladesh batter after Tamim Iqbal to notch a T20I ton. Having played to his strength, Emon would look to keep the momentum going but the other batters have their work cut out to produce a meaningful score after a disappointing first game in the UAE.","Mon May 19, 2025 10:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 10:00 AM"

Alcaraz fended off two set points late in the first set and then seized control in the tie-break before pulling away for a 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 win, his fourth in a row over world number one Sinner. The Spaniard snapped Sinner's 26-match winning run to claim his first Rome crown and seventh Masters 1000 title, denying Italy its first male champion at the tournament since Adriano Panatta in 1976. Alcaraz was also the last player to beat Sinner, in last year's China Open final. Sunday's showdown could well be a prelude to the French Open final, with Sinner and Alcaraz set to be kept apart in the draw as the latter will return to second in the rankings on Monday. Alcaraz, who beat Sinner in a five-set semi-final en route to the Roland Garros trophy 12 months ago, has few doubts the Italian will again be a major contender in the French capital. ""The level he has played in this tournament is insane after three months without playing, without any tournament,"" said Alcaraz. ""I mean, what he has done, it's amazing. I mean, it's something that I have to have respect on that. ""I'm pretty sure he's going to be better and better. This week of practising, he's going to feel better. If he's winning in Roland Garros and he's going farther, I think much better he's going to feel. ""He's going to be a really dangerous player in Paris."" Alcaraz won his third title of the season after eventually dominating Sinner and silencing the over 10,000 fans packed into the centre court stands at the Foro Italico. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a clear message that he is near the top of his game going into the year's second Grand Slam. ""Beating Jannik and winning in Rome, I think both things mixed together give you a great confidence coming to Paris,"" said Alcaraz. ""He's (one of) the best players in the world. It doesn't matter that he was out of the tour for three months. Every tournament he's playing, he plays great. The numbers are there. He wins almost every match he plays. ""That's why I'm even more focused when I play against him. If I don't play at my best, 10 out of 10, it's going to be impossible to beat him."" Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles. The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open. Alcaraz won his second Masters 1000 title of the year in Rome to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona. Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental. Sinner let two set points slip in game 12 of the first set and that was the turning point in the match, with Alcaraz rattling off the first three points of the tie-break before going ahead in the match. Alcaraz then moved through the gears to win the first five games of the second set as he powered to his 19th career title -- drawing level with Sinner. Sinner's encouraging return though sets him up for another deep run at Roland Garros, despite his relative lack of match practice having not played since retaining his Australian Open crown in January before arriving in Rome. ""Talking (in) general, (I'm) very happy about this tournament. It gives me then hopefully confidence to play some good tennis also in Paris,"" said Sinner. ""After three months coming here making this result means a lot to me. ""For sure there are some things like we saw today what we have to improve if we want to do good in Paris. I am closer than expected in a way of everything.""","Mon May 19, 2025 09:46 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 09:51 AM"

While the result had little impact on the La Liga standings—with Barcelona already crowned champions—the England international stressed that there's still plenty to play for. With the domestic title out of reach, Bellingham and Real Madrid have now set their sights on international silverware. ""The Club World Cup is another title and I hope we win it. It's the club and the team's dream,"" said the 20-year-old. FIFA's new premier club competition—the FIFA Club World Cup 2025—will debut on the global stage in June and July, with 32 of the world's leading teams gathering in the USA for the inaugural edition. Speaking to Real Madrid TV after the game, Bellingham added: ""We're happy with the win, but a bit sad because we wanted to fight for the title in these last few games."" Despite being depleted by the absence of regular starters Vinicius Jr. and Rodrygo, Madrid capitalised on their numerical advantage after Loic Bade was sent off just 11 minutes in for denying a clear scoring opportunity.  Sevilla's woes deepened shortly after halftime when substitute Isaac Romero was shown a straight red card for a dangerous tackle on Aurélien Tchouameni. Kylian Mbappe eventually broke the deadlock in the 75th minute with a precise low strike from outside the area. Just five minutes later, the Frenchman turned provider as 21-year-old academy product Gonzalo García crossed for Bellingham to tap in Madrid's second. Reflecting on his goal, Bellingham said: ""It was a good move between the two youngsters and I was there to score an easy goal."" He also praised Mbappe, who is now La Liga's top scorer with 29 goals: ""He's unbelievable. He's a very good player and a good person. It's great to have him in our team."" Real Madrid, who sit second in La Liga with one game remaining, will look to end the season on a high before turning their attention to the global stage—a chance to close the campaign with another piece of silverware.

The Florida derby defeat leaves Miami with just one win from their last seven games in all competitions and they slip to sixth in the Eastern Conference with Orlando leapfrogging them. Messi had just two shots on target in the entire game and even scuffed a free-kick from his favourite spot as his own form slumped with that of his team. ""Now we'll truly see if we're a team in difficult times, because when everything's going well it's very easy,"" Messi told Apple TV following the defeat. ""When difficult times come, that's when we have to be more united than ever, be a true team, and pull ourselves together,"" he added. Messi also questioned the refereeing but in truth the loss had little to do with officiating and much to do with shambolic defending, a disjointed midfield and punchless attack led by the rapidly fading Luis Suarez. Orlando grabbed the lead in the 43rd minute with a goal of absurd simplicity - goalkeeper Pedro Gallese launched the ball down the middle of the field and Luis Muriel ran clear and slotted past Oscar Ustari. The visitors were getting plenty of joy from going direct against a Miami back-line which was all at sea and Argentine Marti Ojeda should have done better when he found himself clear on goal but blasted over the bar. - Coaches 'failing' team - Miami's veteran keeper Ustari then made a fine double save to deny Alexander Freeman and an Ojeda follow up shot but then the 38-year-old found himself to blame for Orlando's second goal. The ball fell to Marco Pasilic on the edge of the box and his low shot went through the hands and legs of Ustari. Miami coach Javier Mascherano then threw on attacking players in a bid to retrieve something from the game but it was largely in vain. In the fourth minute of stoppage time Duncan McGuire broke down the left and his low cross was slotted home by Icelandic forward Dagur Thorhallsson to wrap-up an impressive performance from the visitors. Miami have conceded 20 goals and scored 11 in their last seven games with their only victory coming against the New York Red Bulls on May 3. Mascherano said his team had started as planned before the goal changed the tone of the game. ""I'd say for 25 or 30 minutes we had it completely under control playing in the opponent's half, but this is how it is, clearly. I'm not going to deny what the result is,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, we can't afford the mistakes we make; that's clear, but it's pointless for me to come here and tell this story, because it keeps happening. So, clearly, we as a coaching staff are failing in many of these ways, and we have to try to find a way around them so we don't continue failing and so the team starts getting results,"" he added. Miami's MLS campaign was going well until their exit to the CONCACAF Champions Cup at the hands of the Vancouver Whitecaps and Mascherano admitted the team's morale had been hit. ""Clearly, something has happened where the team has lost a lot of confidence. We have had a drop in level individually and collectively and it's clear one way or another we have tried with different schemes, different names, and still today we are hurting. We will keep trying to find a way.""","Mon May 19, 2025 08:54 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 08:57 AM"
"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/i-was-fighting-bpl-title-so-long-3897946","‘I was fighting for a BPL title for so long’","Malian striker Souleymane Diabate has been a driving force for Mohammedan Sporting Club since joining the Black and Whites in the 2018–19 season. The 34-year-old has stood by the club through thick and think, becoming a symbol of loyalty. This season, his dedication has finally been rewarded with a maiden Bangladesh Premier League title for himself and the club. Club captain Diabate played a pivotal role in the club's historic triumph, netting 10 goals in 15 matches. The Daily Star's Anisur Rahman caught up with the veteran to discuss Mohammedan's triumphant season, his enduring commitment to the club, and much more. The Daily Star (DS): Captain, it took six seasons here at Mohammedan for you to win the league. How did it feel? Souleymane Diabate (SD): I'm so happy. After six long years at Mohammedan, I've made it and we've won the league. So Alhamdulillah, we are champions. I was fighting for this one for so long. DS: How challenging was the league this time, considering the absence of big clubs like Sheikh Jamal DC and Sheikh Rasel KC? SD: This year was our year. All the teams were complete, everything was there. Allah had already decided that Mohammedan was going to win the league. So, no one could change it. This time, the league was very tough [to compete in]. Abahani was there, Bashundhara was there, Fortis and many goods team were there. We fought for it and won. DS: Last season, Mohammedan were runners-up in the league, the Federations Cup as well as the Independence Cup. This time around, you got eliminated from the group-stages of the Federation Cup. Did it fuel you desire to win the league? SD: We were eager to win that. Like I said, it was Allah's will. We were out of the Federation Cup, but it didn't matter because we had won it before. So, this was our chance to win the league. Mohammedan had never won it. So, we were focused on that. The league was more important for us than the Federation Cup. DS: Mohammedan has been struggling to clear payments for a long time and couldn't even clear payments for the last three months. As a professional player, how do you keep yourself motivated in such situations? SD: We are professional players. We play in so many countries before coming to Bangladesh. We face the same problems like we face here. So, we handle the problems and we continue to play by being mentally strong. We are from Africa. We are mentally strong. I knew that Mohammedan was going to pay. They are going to give everything before we leave. So, it was not much of a problem because I have been here for six years. Local players, or foreigners, they are going to pay. That's why we didn't cause any problems and continued to play our football. As far as this season is concerned, I'm telling you that they will pay. Don't worry about the payment. There have been so many problems and the country had collapsed after Sheikh Hasina got toppled. There are business problems but Mohammedan still managed to pay the players. I know they will pay. DS: You were offered to leave Mohammedan two years ago. What made you stay? SD: Football is not all about money. It's about the respect and the love also. So, the love Mohammedan gives me and the respect they give me, that's why I stay. I know if I go to another team, they are not going to give me the same love. We are looking for money but it is not everything. They respect me, they love me, they listen to me also. Anything I say, they will respect it. DS: How do you evaluate Bangladesh Premier League? SD: They need more professionalism for Bangladesh football. Many countries, they are more professional than here. Even our team, they need to be more professional. The league is good, but they need to add more teams, more professionalism. DS: Can Mohammedan supporters expect to see you in Black and White next season? SD: I cannot say anything yet. For now, we are champions and I'll celebrate this one and we'll see if I stay or not.","Mon May 19, 2025 08:00 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 08:00 AM"

After a six-month hiatus, the 37-year-old, playing for Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), registered a golden duck and went wicketless in a crucial clash against Peshawar Zalmi at Rawalpindi Stadium on Sunday. Shakib's last outing for the Tigers was in a Test for Bangladesh against India in Kanpur in September last week. The cricketer, however, has featured for Bangla Tigers in Abu Dhabi T10 competition since that Test. Despite Shakib's flat performance, Lahore emerged victorious, securing a 26-run win to confirm their place in the playoffs. With 11 points from 10 matches, Lahore finished fourth in the standings and will now face off in the Eliminator. Peshawar Zalmi, on the other hand, were eliminated after finishing with just 8 points. Shakib's return to action was delayed by inclement weather in Rawalpindi. A dust storm followed by thunderstorms forced a delay, reducing the match to 13 overs per side. After winning the toss, Peshawar chose to bowl first. Lahore posted 149 for eight, with opener Fakhar Zaman leading the charge, scoring a 36-ball 60. Fellow opener Mohammad Naeem added 22 from 10 balls. Shakib came in to bat in the 11th over but was dismissed on the very first ball, bowled by pacer Ahmed Daniyal. Shakib, attempting a ramp towards fine leg, was undone by a slower delivery, marking the first duck of his 15-match PSL career. This also marked the 31st duck in his 445-match T20 career. With the ball, Shakib had a solid start, conceding just five runs in his first over. However, he was unable to capitalise in his second spell, as Daniyal hit him for two consecutive sixes, leaving Shakib wicketless for 18 runs in his 2 overs. Peshawar's chase faltered as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Despite some late resistance from Daniel Sams, who scored 26 runs off 14 balls, and Daniyal's 24 off 14 balls, Peshawar were restricted to 123 for eight.","Mon May 19, 2025 02:51 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 03:15 AM"
"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/loyalists-rejoice-mohammedan-triumph-3897666","Loyalists rejoice Mohammedan triumph","The vibe would likely have been different had Mohammedan SC clinched their maiden Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) title with a win on the field -- especially after such a dominant display by the Black and Whites throughout the tournament. Instead, their first top-tier league title in 23 years was secured when archrivals Abahani lost to Fortis FC on Saturday. Even though fan frenzy was largely absent, what stood out was the longing of Mohammedan loyalists to see their club end the long trophy drought. Hardly any fans could be seen at the Mohammedan club tent in Motijheel today, but former Mohammedan players like Hasanuzzaman Khan Bablu, Kazi Jasim Uddin Josy, Imtiaz Sultan Jonny, Rumman Bin Wali Sabbir, among many others, turned up at the club premises to celebrate the joyous occasion. There has long been an emotional attachment among these players to one of the country's most popular outfits, which reached its peak with their help in the 1980s and 1990s before enduring a prolonged dry spell without the prestigious league title for over two decades. Understandably, the former players and supporters were exhausted by the repeated failures of their beloved club and had borne the pain of not winning the coveted BPL title – the only trophy missing from Mohammedan's cabinet. Now, they all share the same sentiment -- relief and ecstasy at seeing their side back at the top once again. ""Alhamdulillah, I am very happy because a long-held expectation has finally been fulfilled,"" said Josy, a league-winning Mohammedan member in 1982, 1986, and 1987. ""It has been unbearable to go 23 years without the league title. We were also victims of discrimination when it came to recruiting players. Mohammedan were tagged as 'the opposition', and many didn't dare to finance the club. But the approach changed after the Casino scandal,"" said the former speedy winger. Jonny, who won three league titles with Mohammedan SC, said, ""I can't express my happiness right now. I hadn't even counted the years without the league title – and now I realize it has been 23 years."" ""It's hard to describe the feeling of becoming champions again. We always hoped, but for many years, Mohammedan were fighting to avoid relegation. That was unbearable. It happened due to previous mismanagement,"" said Sabbir, adding that the involvement of former players in the last six years since the Casino scandal helped revive the club's past glory. Former player Sayeed Hasan Kanon called the triumph a result of hard work across all levels and urged the club to take immediate steps to build a strong squad for next season. ""This is the time to form the squad and plan for the next season. It is crucial that we decide about the future while celebrating the title,"" Kanon said. For Mohammedan -- a club that has overcome numerous challenges in recent years -- turning Kanon's words into action is crucial if they are to avoid another 23-year wait for league glory.","Sun May 18, 2025 11:30 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 11:30 PM"

Henderson also saved a first-half penalty from Omar Marmoush but City failed to make their dominance of possession count. ""I just couldn't breathe. They keep the ball so well,"" Eze said of City's fast start. ""We also know when we get up to their box we've got to make it count and just thankful we made it count today because it's not easy.""

The former national team captain, along with his charges, watched on Youtube as their closest rivals, Abahani, got beaten 2-1 by Fortis FC at the Shaheed Dhirendranath Dutta Stadium in Cumilla on Saturday afternoon, effectively handing the Bangladesh Premier League to Mohammedan with three games in hand. Their first title in 18 years of professional football era also ended a 23-year-wait for Bangladesh's most successful club. The 89-year-old club had gone through a lot of ups and downs this century -- having won their last title in 2002 when the league was called Dhaka Premier Division League -- before making a bit of a resurgence under Alfaz, a prodigal son of the club. Following the success, Alfaz said that their biggest satisfaction is bringing back the love and conviction of legions of fans. ""What we have done is bring back people's love for the club. We have instilled belief that we can beat teams like Bashundhara Kings,"" the 51-year-old coach told The Daily Star over phone from the club tent. Abahani, the six-time BPL winners, had the chance to delay Mohammedan's title party had they even been able to register a draw. However, Abahani's defeat against 10-man Fortis had set the players and coaching staff up for party mood. Alfaz, though, isn't entirely convinced that they should start the party already. He feels their success will only be meaningful once they are rewarded by the club management, both figuratively and literally. In the wake of the change in political landscape last year, many sporting clubs have suffered, not the least of whom were Mohammedan themselves. The club has struggled to pay the salaries to the players and the coaching staff, with close to three months' salaries remaining unpaid. Alfaz believes the club's 20th top-tier league title -- the most in Bangladesh's domestic football -- was a result of the sacrifice of the coaching staff and the players as well as contribution of the club's president and the football committee chairman. ""We want that everyone gets paid their dues,"" Alfaz said. ""You don't win championships every other day. We have brought the trophy to Mohammedan. That needs to be taken into cognizance by the club officials. It's time for the officials to pay back."" Under Alfaz, Mohammedan had shown resurgence over the last three seasons. They had won the Federation Cup title in 2022-23 season and reached the final last year too. They lost the final to Bashundhara Kings and endured the same fate in both league and Independence Cup. There was belief, Alfaz said, that the club could become league champions this time, focusing all their energy on this title. Led by their inspirational skipper Souleymane Diabate, Mohammedan notched 38 points from 15 matches, having lost only once and drawing only two matches with a positive goal difference of 26. Diabate has been an integral part of Mohammedan's resurgence, wearing the captain's armband while leading with goals and assists in Mohammedan's success over the last few years. Courted by other clubs time and again, Diabate stayed put at the shabby Mohammedan club tent. On Saturday, Diabate felt his prayers have been answered. ""It is a dream come true for me. I've been here for six or seven years. Many teams wanted me to leave Mohammedan but I told them I want to stay here to give something to Mohammedan. Alhamdulillah my prayers came true and my dream also came true,"" the Malian told reporters at the club tent.","Sun May 18, 2025 09:00 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 09:00 AM"

The Tigers took a 1-0 lead in the series, with the final game scheduled to be played on Monday at the same venue.   A 54-ball 100 from Emon, who reached the three-figure mark in 53 deliveries to become the fastest centurion in the format for Bangladesh, helped the Tigers post a commendable total of 191 for seven.  UAE were on par with the required run rate almost halfway through the innings, but the Tigers bounced back with some quick wickets to bundle out the hosts for 164 in 20 overs.  UAE skipper and opener Muhammad Waseem scored a 39-ball 54 and shared a 62-run third-wicket stand with Rahul Chopra, who scored 35 off 22 deliveries, to keep the hosts on track of a steep chase.  Waseem was dismissed in the 12th over when Tanzim Hasan Sakib had him caught at short fine leg to give the Tigers a crucial breakthrough, breaking the crucial stand between him and Rahul. Sakib returned to pick up the wicket of Rahul as well in the 14th over, having the right-hander miscue a slower wide delivery into the hands of the backward point to leave UAE at 131 for four.  However, some lusty blows by Asif Khan late in the game gave the hosts some hope. Asif smashed off-spinner Mahedi Hasan for three successive sixes in one over to spark hopes of their first-ever win over Bangladesh. UAE had now lost all four of their matches against the Tigers.  But Asif could not complete the job as Hasan Mahmud removed the batter in the penultimate over after a blistering 21-ball 42-run knock that included four maximums and three boundaries.  For Bangladesh, pacer Hasan took three wickets for 33 runs in four overs. Mustafizur Rahman was the most economical of all, picking up two wickets for 17 runs in his four overs.    Earlier, Emon smashed a total of nine sixes and five fours during his blistering innings to become the Bangladeshi with the most sixes in a T20I innings. Rishad Hossain, who was not picked for today's game, previously held the record for hitting seven sixes against Sri Lanka in Sylhet last year.  In total, Bangladesh hit 13 sixes in the innings -- also the highest for the Tigers, surpassing their previous best of 12 maximums against Sri Lanka in the Nidahas Trophy in 2018.     ","Sun May 18, 2025 12:48 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 12:50 AM"

"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/crystal-palace-surprise-man-city-win-fa-cup-3897101","Palace stun Man City to win FA Cup for first time","Crystal Palace stunned Manchester City on Saturday to win the FA Cup for the first time as Eberechi Eze sealed a 1-0 victory that piled on the misery for Pep Guardiola's troubled side. Eze's early strike rocked City before Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson saved Omar Marmoush's penalty late in the first half of a dramatic final at Wembley. While Eze's clinical finish was the culmination of his remarkable rise from rejection by Arsenal, Fulham and Millwall as a youngster, it was Henderson who emerged as Palace's hero with a series of superb saves. City will protest that Henderson should have been sent off for a first-half handball outside his penalty area. But Henderson made the most of that controversial moment to ensure Palace clinched the first major trophy in their 120-year history and a place in next season's Europa League. Beaten by Manchester United in their previous FA Cup final appearances in 1990 and 2016, Palace's shock win was no more than they deserved as City once again imploded in a dismal season that will be their first without major silverware since 2016-17. After winning the Premier League in the previous four seasons, City have endured a turbulent campaign that ranks among the worst in Guardiola's storied managerial career. Currently sixth in the Premier League, City host Bournemouth on Tuesday and travel to Fulham on May 25 as they try to salvage their wretched year by at least qualifying for the Champions League. Guardiola had questioned his players' hunger as they failed to keep pace with Liverpool in the title race and crashed out of the Champions League. While desire might not have been an issue against Palace, City's lack of direction in their second successive FA Cup final defeat was an alarming sign for the future as Guardiola was out-witted by Eagles boss Oliver Glasner. Not for the first time, Guardiola sprang a surprise with his selection for a final as he picked an ultra-attacking line-up with no holding midfielder. - Guardiola gamble backfires - However, Guardiola's habit of tinkering with his tactics for finals has backfired in the past. Asked about City's line-up just before kick-off, Guardiola said he was putting his faith in ""talent"", but Glasner had spotted an opening, saying: ""When you have so many attacking players it could give you an opportunity in transitions."" Erling Haaland nearly gave City the perfect start when he stretched to meet Kevin De Bruyne's cross with a volley that forced a scrambled save from Henderson. Josko Gvardiol's towering header from Savinho's corner was smartly repelled by Henderson. But Glasner's clever decision to set up Palace deep inside their own half had lured City in for the sucker punch. Eze delivered the knockout blow from Palace's first attack in the 16th minute as Glasner's men launched a brilliant break from their penalty area. Jean-Philippe Mateta held up Chris Richards' long pass and laid it off to Daniel Munoz, who surged down the right flank before crossing towards Eze, who guided a superb volley past Stefan Ortega from 12 yards. City were furious when Henderson escaped a red card when VAR checked his handball, which appeared to take place outside the area, after the 'keeper rushed out to challenge Haaland. VAR said it was ""not an obvious goal-scoring opportunity"" but it proved crucial as Henderson rescued Palace in the 35th minute. Tyrick Mitchell conceded the penalty with a needless foul on Bernardo Silva as the City midfielder ran away from goal. Instead of Haaland taking the spot-kick, it was Marmoush who stepped up after the Norway star gave him the ball in a disastrous move as Henderson plunged to his right to keep out the Egyptian's strike. Henderson was in inspired form and he denied City again, clawing away a Jeremy Doku strike that appeared destined for the top corner. Defending tirelessly, Palace were indebted to Henderson, who made two more brilliant saves from Claudio Echeverri to cap a chastening afternoon for Guardiola.","Sat May 17, 2025 11:32 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 11:39 PM"

And yet, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) continues to treat it like an afterthought. Case in point: Bangladesh returned to T20I cricket after five months on Saturday, facing the UAE in Sharjah. The game was well underway -- Bangladesh had raced to 103 for 2 in 10 overs -- before the BCB's official Facebook page finally posted the playing XI. Ironically, the page's bio states: ""Stay up-to-date with all the latest cricket news"".  That's a glaring miss in the most fan-friendly format of the game. In fact, the previous post on the page was over a day old -- celebrating the Emerging Team's win over South Africa. Between then and the toss in Sharjah? Not a single update. Not even a toss update. Some may argue there was nothing to share. That's not true. Fans expect pre-match glimpses -- training shots, travel updates, dressing room buzz. In this case, silence doesn't build anticipation; it kills it. Part of the problem, it seems, is the absence of a dedicated media manager on this tour. That duty has fallen to team manager Nafees Iqbal, but the result has been low-quality videos provided to the media that do little justice to a national team. This digital disengagement would be tone-deaf at the best of times. Right now, it's worse, as BCB is under heavy scrutiny, with the national team consistently underperforming amid mismanagement and controversies in the domestic circuit. As a result, fans are likely to be frustrated. The least the board can do is maintain a basic line of communication and show they care about engagement beyond the boundary. Bangladesh has over 60 million social media users – roughly one-third of the nation's population. Cricket is the country's heartbeat. Reluctance in updating digital platforms with basic developments of the game is not only outdated -- it's disrespectful to the fans who keep the game alive.","Sat May 17, 2025 11:00 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 12:27 AM"

Bayern had already secured the title two weeks ago but were ready to finish their title-winning season in style when Michael Olise whipped in a fierce free kick for a 33rd minute lead. He then turned provider, feeding Joshua Kimmich to power in their second goal eight minutes after the restart. Kane was initially on the bench but hit the post in the second half before providing Serge Gnabry with an assist for Bayern's third goal. The England captain, who won the first major title of his career with the Bundesliga trophy this season, did find the target in the 86th minute, slotting in from close range for his 26th league goal of the season. He became the first player in Bundesliga history to be crowned top scorer in both his first two seasons.","Sat May 17, 2025 10:32 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 10:36 PM"

Also, Emon, who smashed a total of nine sixes and five fours during his blistering innings, now holds the record for most sixes by a Bangladeshi in a T20I innings. Rishad Hossain, who was not picked for today's game, previously held the record for hitting seven sixes against Sri Lanka in Sylhet last year. In total, Bangladesh hit 13 sixes in the innings -- also the highest for the Tigers, surpassing their previous best of 12 maximums against Sri Lanka in the Nidahas Trophy in 2018   Emon brought up his ton off 53 deliveries, taking seven less than Bangladesh's first T20I centurion Tamim Iqbal, who scored 103 against Oman in Dharmashala in the 2016 T20 World Cup. Emon, however, survived a scare when he was on 84 -- he was caught off a Matiullah Khan delivery, only to survive courtesy of the pacer overstepping.  Emon was dismissed after scoring 100 off 54 deliveries in the final over of the game, losing his stumps while trying to hit big off a delivery of UAE pacer Muhammad Jawadullah.  Aside from Emon, only four other batters could reach double-digit scores, with the second-highest contribution coming from extras (21).   Jawadullah returned the best figures for the hosts, scalping four wickets for 21 in his four overs.     Bangladesh opener Parvez Hossain Emon brought up his maiden T20I fifty in a blistering fashion in the first of the two-match series against the UAE at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium today.  Parvez smashed UAE left-arm spinner Haider Ali for a boundary in the ninth over to bring up his fifty off just 28 deliveries. So far, Parvez samshed a total of three boundaries and five maximums, three of which came in the only over bowled by medium pacer Sanchit Sharma. Parvez remains unbeaten on 53 off 30 deliveries, while Towhid Hridoy raced to 20 off 14 deliveries not out. Hridoy also smashed a four and six.  Bangladesh scored 103 for the loss of two wickets in 10 overs.  Skipper Liton Das saw his poor run of form continue, getting dismissed for an eight-ball 11. Opener Tanzid Tamim is the other batter who was dismissed. Tamim scored 10 off nine deliveries.     Hosts UAE have won the toss and elected to bowl first in the first of the two-match T20I series against Bangladesh at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium today.  Najmul Hossain Shanto, who recently stepped aside from his role as the Tigers' T20I skipper and also missed their last West Indies tour due to injury, was dropped from the side. Shanto endured a poor run of form in the shortest format in recent times.  Leg-spinner Rishad Hossain and Nahid Rana also did not make the eleven for the game.  Bangladesh are going in with three pacers -- Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Hasan Mahmud, and Mustafizur Rahman -- and two spin options, including all-rounder Mahedi Hasan and left-arm spinner Tanvir Islam.    Playing XIs: UAE: Muhammad Waseem(c), Muhammad Zohaib, Alishan Sharafu, Rahul Chopra(w), Asif Khan, Dhruv Parashar, Sanchit Sharma, Muhammad Zuhaib, Matiullah Khan, Haider Ali, Muhammad Jawadullah Bangladesh: Litton Das(c), Parvez Hossain Emon, Tanzid Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Jaker Ali(w), Shamim Hossain, Mahedi Hasan, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Tanvir Islam, Hasan Mahmud, Mustafizur Rahman","Sat May 17, 2025 08:31 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 11:12 PM"

The Black and Whites, who managed four runners-up finish but never won the league title since professional football was introduced in Bangladesh in 2007, have secured their maiden title with three games in hand. The title makes the Motijheel outfit the fifth team to win the coveted trophy behind six-time champions Abahani, five-time winners Bashundhara Kings, three-time champions Sheikh Jamal and one-time champions Sheikh Russel. The Black and Whites had to wait for 23 years to get their hands on the top-tier league title, having lost won the then Dhaka Premier Division League title back in 2002. Overall, this is the 20th top-tier league title -- the most in domestic football -- for the historic club that was founded in 1936.   Mohammedan, who beat Chittagong Abahani 4-1 at the same venue on Friday, have 38 points from 15 matches, 10 ahead of Abahani who had the opportunity to delay Mohammedan's title-party either with a victory or a draw today. However, the Sky Blues struggled against a spirited Fortis FC team amid pouring rain in Cumilla, conceding the lead in the 19th minute, with Pa Omar Babou placing home a spot-kick after being brought down inside the box.  Abahani thought they would get back in the match when Fortis FC's Monjurur Rahman Manik saw a direct red card in the 75th minute for lashing out at Abahani forward Suman Reza. However, a superb speculative goal from Sajed Jummon Nijhum -- the forward chipping Abahani's onrushing goalkeeper Mitul Marma from a distance -- got Abahani all but out of the contest.   The Sky Blues, though, hit back three minutes later, with Mohammad Ridoy heading home Raphael Augusto's corner-kick before pulling up their socks and launching numerous attacks. However, Fortis FC, who are now sixth on the table with 22 points, held their own and celebrated the victory. The real celebration though started in Motijheel, who had yearned long for this day.   ","Sat May 17, 2025 06:29 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 06:55 PM"

Huijsen will be available for Real Madrid at the Club World Cup in the United States this summer, with their first game against Al-Hilal on June 18 in Miami.

With Lahore needing a win to qualify for the playoffs, the game effectively serves as a quarterfinal for them. A defeat would see the defending champions crash out of the tournament. Alongside Shakib, Sri Lanka's Kusal Perera and Bhanuka Rajapaksa have also joined the Qalandars, significantly strengthening the squad for the business end of the tournament. Shakib was initially roped in as a replacement for injured New Zealander Daryl Mitchell, but is currently expected to play only the final league-stage match. Should Lahore progress, his availability for the playoffs will be assessed based on fitness and team requirements.

""Since this format comes with a lot of mental challenges, I want every player to play freely in their role. I want them to enjoy the game without thinking too much about the result. The result will come -- what matters to me is how well we follow the process,"" he added. Liton also emphasised the team's intention to work on specific problem areas during this series. ""Our first goal in these two matches is to win both -- that's our top priority. At the same time, we'll try to address the issues we've been working on recently and make progress in those areas,"" he said. Bangladesh have struggled with top-order batting for some time -- an area the Tigers will be aiming to improve during the series. Liton himself has been short of runs lately, making this an opportunity for him to rediscover his form. The Tigers have won all three of their previous T20Is against UAE. However, during their last UAE visit in 2022, they were pushed to the limit in one match.

"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/villa-sink-spurs-bolster-bid-reach-champions-league-3896531","Villa sink Spurs to bolster bid to reach Champions League","Aston Villa bolstered their bid to qualify for the Champions League as they beat Tottenham 2-0 to climb into fifth place in the Premier League on Friday. Unai Emery's side had no margin for error at Villa Park as the race for top five places approaches a dramatic conclusion. Second-half goals from Ezri Konsa and Boubacar Kamara ensured Villa's battle to play in Europe's elite club competition will go down to the last day of the season. Fourth-placed Chelsea's 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Friday means Villa still need sixth-placed Manchester City -- one point behind Emery's men -- to lose against Bournemouth in their game in hand on Tuesday to be in control of their own destiny. Villa have won five of their last six games and one more victory at Manchester United on May 25 -- plus a City loss in one of their remaining two matches -- would seal their target of finishing in the top five. ""We won and we are on a run but still have work to do. We have to ready. We have a chance to play in the Champions League,"" Emery said. ""We were consistent, demanding and when we scored the first goal, they gave up. We needed to manage the 90 minutes and we worked it well. ""We are in a good moment. We are being demanding. We can get Champions League -- fantastic."" Tottenham were far more concerned with their own route into the Champions League -- winning the Europa League final against Manchester United in Bilbao on Wednesday. Languishing in 17th place after their 21st league defeat this term, Ange Postecoglou's troubled team are set for their worst finish since being relegated from the top-flight in 1976-77. Tottenham are without a win in their last six league matches, losing five times in that dismal streak. Already without injured trio Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Lucas Bergvall for the final, Postecoglou rested a host of key players including Dominic Solanke, Cristian Romero and Rodrigo Bentancur. Postecoglou had admitted Tottenham couldn't afford any more fitness problems, but his understudies succumbed to the latest lacklustre loss in a woeful season that could end in the Australian's sacking regardless of the result against United. Before kick-off, Villa fans posed with a replica of the European Cup trophy the club won in 1982. That final triumph against Bayern Munich remains Villa's finest achievement, but this season's memorable run to the Champions League quarter-finals excited the club's supporters. For Villa to remain in contention for another campaign among Europe's elite, victory against Tottenham was essential. Tottenham captain Son Heung-min was back in the starting line-up after a month out injured and the South Korea forward went close early on, cutting in from the left flank for a curler that flashed over. Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez had to make an alert save to keep out Wilson Odobert's audacious back-heeled effort from Mathys Tel's cross. Emery's men hit back after those escapes and Morgan Rogers forced a superb save from Tottenham keeper Antonin Kinsky, who clawed away the midfielder's flick before it could bounce in. Villa's failure to make the breakthrough in the first half against a team with their minds elsewhere raised the tension levels after the interval, but Konsa eased the mounting anxiety in the 59th minute. John McGinn's corner was flicked on by Ollie Watkins and Konsa took advantage of Tottenham's slow response as he swept a composed finish past Kinsky. Villa went for the kill and Watkins' close-range shot was repelled by Kinsky's fine stop. Kamara put the result beyond doubt in the 73rd minute, taking Rogers' pass and lashing home from the edge of the area.","Sat May 17, 2025 10:00 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 10:00 AM"

Alexander-Arnold is widely expected to join Real Madrid once his contract expires in June. The England right-back, who revealed his decision to quit his boyhood club last week, was jeered by Liverpool supporters when he came on as a second-half substitute in Sunday's 2-2 draw against Arsenal at Anfield. Salah said on Friday that he was saddened by the taunts aimed at Alexander-Arnold, who has two games left as a Liverpool player against Brighton on Monday and Crystal Palace on May 25. ""Absolutely. I was surprised because this is not how we act as Liverpool fans,"" the Egypt forward told Gary Neville in a Sky Sports interview. ""I think somehow the fans were being harsh with him. I think he didn't deserve it at the time, he deserved the fans to treat him the best way possible because he gave it all to the fans."" Salah was also involved in a prolonged contract saga this season, but eventually committed his future to the Reds by signing a new two-year deal. Calling for Liverpool fans to give Alexander-Arnold a more respectful farewell in his last two games, Salah said: ""Imagine someone who gives you his all for 20 years. It's shouldn't be like this. ""I hope that will change next game, against Brighton or in the last game of the season, because he deserves the farewell."" Liverpool-born Alexander-Arnold, who made his first-team debut in 2016, has made 353 senior appearances for Liverpool in all competitions, scoring 23 goals. The 26-year-old has won two Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the League Cup with the Reds. Salah admitted it will be emotional to say goodbye to one of his close friends when the season ends. ""I told him yesterday don't give me eye contact in your farewell. I really love him. I think he deserves the best farewell leaving the club,"" he said. ""He has done a lot for the city and done a lot for the club and he's one of probably the best players in the club's history. He gave it all. ""I think he needed a new challenge. He spoke to me about it. It's his decision for sure. He's 25, 26 years old and won it all twice or three times. What more can he have done?""","Sat May 17, 2025 09:30 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 09:30 AM"

Arteta's side have now gone five years without a trophy as they approach the end of a frustrating campaign marred by injuries to key forwards Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Jesus. That trio, as well as influential midfielder Martin Odegaard, all missed substantial chunks of the season as Arsenal failed to keep pace with Premier League champions Liverpool before losing the Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. A new striker is top of Arteta's wish-list with Havertz, who has not played for almost four months, still the club's top scorer in the league with just nine goals. Arsenal are believed to have at least £100 million ($132 million) at their disposal for new players and have been linked with RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Newcastle's Alexander Isak. After failing to lure England striker Ollie Watkins from Aston Villa during the January transfer window, Arteta is willing to do whatever it takes to get a new striker in the summer. ""The thing is that the budget is like when you have your wedding, you plan your wedding with your wife and you give her a budget and never less, and it's always more,"" Arteta told reporters on Friday. ""When you build a house it's always more. Normally this happens. And you prepare for different scenarios. Then unfortunate things happen. Sometimes we want a player and suddenly we have an injury or that player gets injured. ""There are so many variables that can happen but there is a budget. There is always an idea of what we can do, what we can improve, what the priorities are going to be and then let's see if we can do it."" Amid speculation this week that Arteta and Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta, who replaced Edu in March, have disagreed over which striker to pursue, the manager insisted their relationship is fine. ""Well, if that happens, that means that we cannot explain ourselves well enough, and we are not clear enough on what we want, and I guarantee you that hasn't happened,"" he said. ""It didn't happen in five and a half years with Edu, and I guarantee you it hasn't happened with Andrea. ""We have learned a lot and some of them (transfers) have worked really well and others have not. So we have to make sure that we make the right calls. ""But we are all human beings and unfortunately, nobody has got a crystal ball here. ""But Andrea is someone who is very driven, very clear in his ideas, in his vision and how we want to achieve it."" Second-placed Arsenal, who host third-placed Newcastle on Sunday, head into the final two matches of the season needing just two points to be assured of Champions League qualification. However, with their superior goal difference, one point should be enough for Arsenal to secure a top-five finish.","Sat May 17, 2025 09:00 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 09:00 AM"

United are gearing up for next week's Europa League final against Tottenham but ran the Blues close as Ruben Amorim named a stronger line-up than expected. However, the Red Devils ultimately slipped to an 18th league defeat of the season and remain 16th in the table. Chelsea and Aston Villa, who beat Spurs 2-0 in Friday's other Premier League match, both leapfrog Manchester City into the top five. City have a game in hand at home to Bournemouth on Tuesday as they face Crystal Palace in Saturday's FA Cup final. But Chelsea will be assured of a return to Europe's top competition after a two-year absence should they beat Nottingham Forest on the final day of the season. And they could also end the campaign with a trophy as they face Real Betis in the Europa Conference League final on May 28. ""Now only two games left to achieve something special,"" said Cucurella. ""Today is a moment to enjoy because we work all season for these moments so now we have ambitions to achieve these things."" United's miserable season can only be saved by victory in Bilbao in five days' time but Amorim resisted the temptation to rest his key men at Stamford Bridge. ""Today was a really good game to prepare the final,"" said Amorim. ""Almost 10 days without playing for me would be a mistake. ""It was a good thing for them to play, to feel that they can do it. We can control the game, we can have possession, we can push the opponent. ""But in the end, in this club and any club you need to win and we are not winning."" Chelsea were without a recognised striker due to Nicolas Jackson's suspension and the continued absence due to injury of Christopher Nkunku. Teenager Tyrique George, a natural winger, was forced to lead the line up front and the Blues' lack of a focal point saw them easily snuffed out. United's bright start was nearly rewarded when Harry Maguire fired in Bruno Fernandes' inviting cross only for a VAR review to show the centre-back had strayed centimetres offside. Chelsea's best effort before half-time saw Reece James' long-range effort come back off the post. United started strongly again in the second period but failed to make it count as Mason Mount fired wide on his return to Stamford Bridge, before Fernandes blasted over. On the hour mark a VAR review came to the visitors' aid when referee Chris Kavanagh initially pointed to the penalty spot after a challenge between George and Andre Onana. However, replays showed the goalkeeper clearly played the ball and the spot-kick was overturned. With Chelsea's forward players lacking inspiration, the match-winning moment was created and converted by their full-backs 20 minutes from time. James turned nearly on the edge of the box and clipped in a cross that Cucurella met perfectly to head in his seventh goal of the season. Noni Madueke should have doubled the lead within seconds when he skewed wide after a slick pass from Cole Palmer. That miss could have been costly had Robert Sanchez not denied Amad Diallo at his near post with United's only shot on target. But Chelsea held their nerve to edge towards the brink of a return to the riches and glamour of the Champions League.","Sat May 17, 2025 08:00 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 08:05 AM"
"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/tigers-begin-t20-tune-under-liton-sharjah-3896171","Tigers begin T20 tune-up under Liton in Sharjah","Five months following a three-match T20I series clean sweep win in the West Indies, Bangladesh are back in the shortest format as they take on hosts UAE in the first of two T20Is at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium today. While the series may appear to be just a warm-up ahead of a packed T20 calendar -- featuring bilateral series with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India, and major tournaments like the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup -- it holds real value. With a five-T20I tour of Pakistan to follow, and the Asia Cup likely to be staged in the UAE, these games offer a timely opportunity to assess conditions and sharpen plans. This series also marks a new chapter for Bangladesh, as Liton Das begins his tenure as full-time captain in the shortest format. Though he previously led the team on an interim basis, this is his first full-time appointment in the format, lasting through to the next year's T20 World Cup. The team will be hoping Liton can inspire a more aggressive and exciting style of cricket. Liton has led Bangladesh to some notable results across formats, including a home ODI series win over India and a T20 series victory in the West Indies. But with the captaincy now confirmed, there's also hope that he can regain form with the bat. In 2024, he managed only one fifty in 20 T20I innings, averaging just 16.26. Beyond Liton, the focus will also be on Bangladesh's ability to get their team balance right -- a necessity ahead of tougher assignments. Tactical calls may be required, such as whether to accommodate former captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, and if so, how to structure the starting line-up without compromising bowling options. Spin remains a strength, led by Mahedi Hasan and Rishad Hossain, while the pace arsenal -- featuring Hasan Mahmud, Nahid Rana, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam and Tanzim Hasan Sakib -- offers the kind of variety that can trouble even elite batting line-ups. Meanwhile, the UAE have left out many of their top cricketers for the series against Bangladesh and named a relatively inexperienced side, led by opening batter Muhammad Waseem -- the highest run-getter in T20Is in the world since his debut in 2021. Regarding the head-to-head results, the Tigers are still unbeaten against the UAE in this format, having won all three games. But in 2022, when both sides last played in Dubai during a two-match series, the hosts gave the Tigers decent challenges in both losing affairs. As the sun sets over Sharjah, Bangladesh embark on more than just another T20 assignment. This is a moment of recalibration -- a chance to not only tune up combinations and strategies, but to redefine how they approach this format under a fresh leader. Will Liton's leadership spark a shift in the Tigers' T20 identity? Can the team find fluency, intent and balance before the heavyweight challenges ahead? The answers may begin to unfold tonight -- under lights, under scrutiny, and under new leadership.              ","Sat May 17, 2025 08:00 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 08:05 AM"

Tudor took over in March from Thiago Motta, with Juve out of the Champions League and Coppa Italia and on the back of two heavy Serie A defeats. The new manager has lost one in seven and his side are fourth in the standings with two games left. ""Talking about my work is difficult. For me it was a good job given all the problems we had,"" Tudor told reporters ahead of Sunday's home game with mid-table Udinese. ""We played two games with 10 players (after red cards). We played some good games and against Parma we didn't deserve to lose (1-0 last month). I always had a good feeling after games. ""Then, we always have to be demanding and always try to win, but the team gave everything it could. When I arrived, the team was in the deepest hole."" Tudor believes things could have gone even better if injuries had not hampered his side. ""It's fair to say that we never had (Federico) Gatti and (Teun) Koopmeiners, rarely had (Andrea) Cambiaso and (Lloyd) Kelly available,"" Tudor said. ""I think it's right to say things from my point of view. I don't want to apologise, but it's fair to say it. This team, when complete, is strong and can fight with everyone."" Tudor has a contract until the end of this season. The club have the option to renew the deal for another year if Juventus qualify for the Champions League, although that becomes an obligation after July 30. The usual Italian media speculation over managerial changes has linked league-leading Napoli's coach Antonio Conte with a return to Juve, where the club's former player won three Serie A titles as manager, but Tudor is unconcerned. ""I live from day-to-day, I enjoy everything and I suffer,"" Tudor said. ""I want to feel the trust of the players and I feed on this. That's the beauty of it. I don't feel inferior to anyone."" Juventus face a battle to hold onto fourth spot, with fifth-placed Lazio level with them on 64 points and AS Roma one point behind, while Bologna and AC Milan are also eyeing the last Champions League spot. Udinese are 12th on 44 points.  ","Sat May 17, 2025 12:08 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 12:20 AM"

Captain Nazmul Huda Faisal led from the front after assisting the first goal for Ashikur Rahman before tapping in the second within a span of seven minutes in the second half to ensure Bangladesh's final berth, though Nepal tried to bite back with a late goal from Sujan Dangol. Golam Rabbani Choton's charges will take on favourites India in the final on Sunday. The hosts stormed into the final with a 3-0 win over Maldives in the second semifinal.  At Golden Jubilee Stadium, both teams fought equally, as expected. Bangladesh enjoyed a lion's share of possession and created more chances, but it was Nepal who came close to breaking the deadlock after 15 minutes. However, goalkeeper Ismail Hossain Mahin denied the Nepalese forwards, while Nepal were also thwarted by the woodwork on the half-hour mark. Bangladesh squandered two chances afterwards before Nepal defender Madan Paudel made a goalline save, thwarting a goal-bound header 10 minutes into the second half. After surviving a fumble from goalkeeper Mahin, Bangladesh broke the deadlock in the 74th minute, with Ashikur nodding in a well-judged corner from Nazmul, who then doubled the lead with a tap-in after substitute Mohammad Manik brilliantly snatched the ball from a Nepalese defender and squared it for Nazmul inside the box in the 81th minute. Nepal bit back to pull one back in the 87th minute, with Sujan side-volleying a low cut-back into the net, giving goalkeeper Mahin no chance to react. Nepal then tried to level the margin, but the charges of Golam Rabbani Choton held firm and left the ground without further damage, confirming a back-to-back final in the youth tournament of the regional championship. After confirming the final berth, head coach Choton said they had the advantage of a three-day rest before the semi-final match against Nepal. ""It had really been tough for us to play two group-stage matches against Maldives and Bhutan on May 9 and 11, but it was an advantage for us to work for three days with the boys before the semi-final,"" Choton said.

Rakibul made a 40-ball 42 before his dismissal to Dian Forrester brought an end to a fantastic partnership, but Mahfuzur continued his good work with the bat and made 58 off 77 balls to help the home side post 225 runs all out in 45.5 overs. For the visitors, Sesona Tsepo Ndwandwa took three wickets while Van Vuuren claimed two wickets. The South African side also struggled in the chase, mostly due to a great bowling effort from the host spinners led by Rakibul. At one stage, the visitors were left struggling at 94-7 in the 22nd over.

Hazlewood is expected to rejoin Royal Challengers Bengaluru ahead of the IPL play-offs, which are set to begin on May 29. Starc will sacrifice roughly half a million dollars by opting out of the remainder of the tournament. The competition will resume Saturday but faces losing several top stars for the closing stages because of clashes with the schedules of international teams including Australia, England and South Africa. Four days of drone, missile and artillery exchanges from May 7 left around 70 people, including dozens of civilians, dead on both sides of the border.

Dharamsala is less than 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the town of Jammu, where explosions were reported hours earlier the same day.

Starc told the Delhi Capitals that he will not return, Australian media reported, freeing him up to focus on the build-up to his country's World Test Championship final against South Africa on June 11 at Lord's. There was no immediate confirmation from the Delhi team or the IPL. Australia captain Pat Cummins and star batter Travis Head will both return to India, but the plans of other Australians is unclear.

The 33-year-old has been out of action since tearing his left hamstring in December and underwent surgery in January to get rid of an issue that has plagued him in recent years. The talismanic all-rounder, who has occasionally been forced to play as a specialist batter because of the injury, said he had gone through one of the longest rehab periods of his career. ""I've worked incredibly hard on all aspects of everything, from my cricket to fitness, and know I'm going to be in a position when I am back on the field to potentially be in physically the best possible shape I have been in,"" he told Sky Sports. Stokes will return to the England side for a one-off Test against Zimbabwe from May 22 at Trent Bridge before they host India for five Tests followed by the Ashes series in Australia. The Durham player was pleased with how his training had gone but was aware that playing a real match will be more demanding. ""As excited as I am to get back on the field I do know it's going to be different to my training,"" he said. ""But in terms of my role as a player, that full seamer, batting at six, trying to dominate every situation I find myself whether I've got a bat or ball in my hand is what I want to get back doing out on the field, on the biggest stage. ""I know I've done it before, it's something I've very confident in myself I can do.""","Fri May 16, 2025 01:26 PM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 01:31 PM"

Kick-off is scheduled for 4 pm (Bangladesh time) at the Golden Jubilee Stadium in Yupia.

"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/top-news/news/how-will-team-management-justify-shantos-inclusion-3895586","How will team management justify Shanto's inclusion?","The UAE series beginning Saturday will provide an answer as to how Bangladesh actually see themselves in the shortest format -- a side that goes with a progressive mindset or a side that quivers and goes back to the shell of insecurity. Much of that conversation centres around Najmul Hossain Shanto, who recently stepped down from captaincy, handing the reins to Liton Das. Yet, despite a dreadful run of form, Shanto has retained his place in the squad for the UAE and the subsequent Pakistan tours, both featuring only T20Is. During his captaincy stint that ended in January, Shanto amassed 394 runs at an average of 18.76 and a strike-rate of 104.23 in 24 matches, throughout which he only managed a solitary half-century. Interestingly, these numbers are not far off from his career stats, with a career average of 22.85 and strike-rate 108.35. When Shanto was the skipper, his inclusion in the eleven was inevitable. The irony, however, is that now the shield of captaincy has worn out, Shanto does not even merit a place in the side considering his T20 figures, as well as the act of balancing out the eleven. The only way that Shanto might be able to crack the eleven is if the Tigers go in with an extra batter, meaning they would play seven batters, sacrificing a regular bowling option against a side that are six spots below the ninth-ranked Bangladesh in T20Is. Bangladesh possess Tanzid Tamim, Parvez Emon, Soumya Sarkar and Liton Das who could open the batting. For Shanto to come in, Soumya, given his all-round credentials, would have to start at the top alongside any of the aforementioned four. With Soumya in, Liton would drop down to number three -- a position the team management is already pondering with the right-hander in mind. And that would also mean Bangladesh go with four genuine bowling options -- predictably two pacers, including any one of Mustafizur Rahman, Nahid Rana, Hasan Mahmud, Shoriful Islam and Tanzim Sakib -- alongside leg-spinner Rishad Hossain and all-rounder Mahedi Hasan, with Soumya and someone like Shamim Hossain having to share the responsibility of a fifth bowler. It would not be surprising if Bangladesh go down this conservative route of going in with an extra batter even against a low-ranked side, especially given their collapse against UAE back in 2022. But such a strategy may not serve them well in the long run, with 16 T20Is scheduled before this year's Asia Cup. As it seems, the dilemma for Bangladesh remains: is Shanto worth the tactical compromise? If he fails again, the decision to include him will be under scrutiny. Or, will Bangladesh finally take the bold step of leaving him out and backing a lineup that aligns with the demands of the ever-evolving format?","Fri May 16, 2025 08:00 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 04:39 PM"
"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/yamal-rises-stardom-stellar-year-capped-title-triumph-3895886","Yamal rises to stardom in stellar year capped with title triumph","Barcelona's 28th Spanish league title caps a remarkable season defined by teenage sensation Lamine Yamal, who at 17 has emerged as world football's most electrifying talent. Following in the footsteps of fellow graduates of Barca's La Masia academy Gavi and Ansu Fati, Yamal first made his mark internationally last summer, helping Spain win the European Championship. Since then, his mesmerizing performances have drawn comparisons to La Masia's greatest product, Lionel Messi. Yamal reached his 100th Barcelona appearance last month -three years younger than Messi was when he achieved the same feat - during a thrilling 3-3 draw with Inter Milan at Montjuic, where he became the youngest player ever to score in a Champions League semi-final. Record-breaking has become routine for Yamal. He became the youngest goalscorer in European Championship history last year with a stunning long-range shot against France that helped his side reach the final, where they beat England and he was named Young Player of the tournament. He is the youngest player to debut and score for Spain and in LaLiga, the Champions League and the Euros. He also holds the records for youngest player in a Clasico and youngest scorer in both the Super Cup and Copa del Rey. His performance against Inter Milan established him as a frontrunner for the 2025 Ballon d'Or award. Even as Barcelona narrowly missed reaching their first Champions League final in a decade - with Inter fighting back to win 4-3 in extra time in the second leg at San Siro - Yamal remained exceptional, repeatedly threatening to equalise in extra time only to be denied by goalkeeper Yann Sommer's saves and the woodwork. Yamal has been the heartbeat of Barcelona's attack this season with 15 LaLiga assists and 25 across all competitions, plus 17 goals in 53 appearances, including the first in the 2-0 win against Espanyol on Thursday that clinched Barca the title. His contributions helped Hansi Flick's Barcelona become an offensive juggernaut, with the attacking trio of Yamal, Robert Lewandowski, and Raphinha accounting for 91 of the team's 169 goals this season. As the campaign concludes, the football world watches to see what the young playmaker achieves next. His immediate challenge comes next month in Germany, where Spain will defend their Nations League title - another opportunity for Yamal to strengthen his case as the world's best player.","Fri May 16, 2025 06:30 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 06:30 AM"

The 22-year-old centre-back said in a statement that documents from a Gran Canaria court indicated that his possible involvement in the case was limited ""to the possible momentary viewing of some images by a third party, without attributing any involvement to me in the recording or dissemination"". In September 2023, three unnamed players were arrested at Real Madrid's training centre following a complaint lodged by the mother of the 16-year-old girl who appears in the video, filmed in June that year. On Wednesday a judge in Gran Canaria court indicted ""four footballers"" in the case, not mentioning Asencio by name, before making some clarifications on Thursday. ""I have not participated in any behaviour that infringes upon the sexual freedom of any woman, much less minors,"" said Asencio in a statement. ""This is confirmed by the resolution issued by the... court, which does not accuse me of having engaged in sexual relations with the two women involved, nor of having recorded them, with or without their consent. ""Likewise, the court order clarifies that I was not the one who sent any intimate images or videos to third parties which, I reiterate, were recorded in a place different from where I was."" Asencio said he would defend himself if the case is taken to trial. ""The indictment formulated against me, as expressly indicated by the judicial resolution itself, has a strictly provisional nature,"" continued Asencio. ""The presumption of innocence must continue to prevail. ""In the event that charges are eventually made and a trial is opened, I will continue to defend myself before the courts and tribunals, in which I maintain full confidence, reaffirming my detachment from any criminal conduct."" Asencio has established himself as a first-team regular in his breakthrough season at Madrid. Fans at various stadiums around Spain have jeered Asencio, with some Barcelona fans chanting ""Asencio, to jail"" during the Clasico on Sunday. Real Madrid's Copa del Rey semi-final win at Real Sociedad in February was briefly paused by the referee after home fans chanted ""Asencio die"".","Fri May 16, 2025 03:59 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 04:02 AM"

Yamal's effort and Fermin Lopez's goal took Hansi Flick's side seven points clear of Los Blancos with two matches remaining, to clinch Barcelona's 28th title and complete a superb domestic treble, as they won the Copa del Rey earlier this month and also the Super Cup in Saudi Arabia in January.   Only the Champions League escaped an exciting young Barca side this season, as they won the league for the second time in six years, at Espanyol's ground again just as in 2023. Back then, celebrating Barca players were chased from the field by angry home supporters but this time Espanyol turned on the sprinklers to soak the jubilant visitors, who headed down the tunnel quickly. Yamal opened the scoring after 53 minutes of a tense derby clash with a brilliant curling effort, before Lopez added another in the 95th minute to secure victory. Outside the stadium before the match several Espanyol fans were hit by a car which drove into a big crowd, although none were seriously injured and police said it appeared to be an accident. Barcelona were seconds away from sealing their title triumph on Wednesday but Real Madrid snatched a 95th-minute winner against Mallorca to delay the inevitable. Flick's side started slowly in Cornella, with Espanyol, 16th, looking dangerous on the counter-attack and keen to secure their top-flight survival. Wojciech Szczesny made a fine save to deny Javi Puado who broke through on goal in Espanyol's best chance of the opening period. Barca dominated the ball but failed to create any clear opportunities themselves in the first half. The Catalan giants have often blown teams away this season, approaching a century of goals in LaLiga, but with the title on the line and a hostile crowd against them, they needed something special to break through. That came from 17-year-old wing wizard Yamal, who zipped inside off the right flank and unleashed a rocket into the top corner from outside the box, in a replica of his goal for Spain against France in the Euro 2024 semi-finals. It was the teenager's eighth LaLiga strike of the season but with goals in both matches against rivals Real and also in the visit to face Atletico Madrid, he has a penchant for the big occasion. Barca's superb display in Sunday's Clasico, in which they beat their rivals 4-3 in a thrilling battle, effectively won them the title. They still had to get it over the line against their neighbours, though, and that became easier when Leandro Cabrera was sent off for an elbow into Yamal's stomach. Even though they had a player fewer, Espanyol pressured Barcelona heavily until Lopez drilled past Joan Garcia to end the hosts' resistance.","Fri May 16, 2025 03:35 AM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 03:45 AM"

Alongside the return of the captain, Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and Racing Strasbourg's Valentín Barco have also been recalled. Both youngsters were initially seen as future stars by Scaloni but are still working to cement their place in the senior setup. Garnacho, despite recent tensions with Manchester United coach Ruben Amorim, has been a key figure in the club's attack. Barco, meanwhile, has revived his career in France and become an important presence on the left flank. Other notable call-ups include Juan Foyth (Villarreal), Nicolás Domínguez (Nottingham Forest), and Valentín Castellanos (Lazio), all of whom have impressed at club level. However, the list also sees the omission of several experienced names. Germán Pezzella, Marcos Acuna, and Gonzalo Montiel have not been included, with only Montiel sidelined due to a muscle injury. The rest have been left out for tactical or form-related reasons. Surprisingly, Bologna duo Santiago Castro and Benjamín Domínguez, who recently lifted the Italian Cup, were not named. Their exclusion, despite recent success, raises eyebrows. Paulo Dybala remains absent as well. The Roma forward, who underwent surgery in March for a thigh injury, has not returned to action and continues his recovery. Scaloni is expected to finalise his squad closer to the matches, with only fully fit players to be included in the final selection.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) recently sent the BCB a revised itinerary of the series, and according to that, the series will start on May 27 in Faisalabad. According to the previous fixture, Bangladesh were set to face the hosts on May 25 in the series opener in Faisalabad but due to the recent change in fixture of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which will resume on May 17 and run until May 25, the PCB had to change the Bangladesh fixtures as the opening game of the series clashed with PSL final date. The national team is currently in the UAE to face the hosts in a two-match T20I series in Sharjah. The two matches are slated on May 17 and 19, respectively. The Tigers are expected to leave for Pakistan directly from the UAE if the series takes place. Otherwise, they will return home after featuring in the two-match series.","Thu May 15, 2025 06:01 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 07:37 PM"

The IPL will resume on Saturday after India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire following days of fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours. The South Africa squad for the June 11-15 WTC final at Lord's includes eight players who are playing in the lucrative IPL, the final for which has been moved from May 25 to June 3. South Africa were scheduled to assemble in England on May 31 May and play a warm-up match against Zimbabwe from June 3-6 before heading to London. Royal Challengers Bengaluru posted a video on social media on Thursday confirming the return of several of their players, including Ngidi. ""Back at base and locked in!,"" the franchise said. South Africans Tristan Stubbs and Aiden Markram - both part of the WTC final squad - are set to rejoin Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants respectively, ESPNcricinfo reported. Both IPL franchises did not immediately respond to Reuters calls and messages seeking confirmation. A Punjab Kings official confirmed South African Marco Jansen was scheduled to rejoin the IPL side. Bengaluru, chasing their maiden IPL title, have been reinforced by the returns of English trio Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell and Phil Salt. Australian Tim David and West Indian Romario Shepherd have also linked up with Bengaluru, who play Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday. Jos Buttler will reunite with Gujarat Titans but will skip the playoff, should his team qualify, to be available for England's six limited-overs matches against West Indies beginning on May 29.","Thu May 15, 2025 05:42 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 05:48 PM"

Three of those wins came away from home -- a 2-0 series win against Pakistan and a win over the West Indies in the Caribbean last year. They also won one game against New Zealand at home in December 2023.   In the previous two WTC cycles, Bangladesh managed to win just a solitary game -- a historic victory against New Zealand at Mount Maunganui in the second cycle (2021-2023) after going winless in their first WTC foray between 2019-2021.    Meanwhile, the winners of the WTC Final, to be played between Australia and South Africa at Lord's from 11-15 June, will take home a purse of $3.6 million, more than double of what New Zealand (2021) and Australia (2023) earned after winning the previous two finals. The losing finalists, too, will earn more than the earlier top prize money, assured of more than $2.1 million this time. The winners of the previous two editions won $1.6 million while the losing finalists got $800,000. The increase in prize money exhibits the ICC's efforts to prioritise Test cricket as it looks to build on the momentum of the first three cycles of the nine-team competition. The third edition saw South Africa finish on a high with 2-0 home series wins over Sri Lanka and Pakistan, ending with 69.44 percentage points. Defending champions Australia finished with 67.54 points while India finished with 50.00 after leading the table for much of the time. ICC Chair Mr. Jay Shah wished the finalists the very best as they set their sights on the Test Mace. ICC Chair Jay Shah: ""We have witnessed a very interesting third cycle of the ICC World Test Championship, where the finalists were decided only towards the end of the competition. ""The championship has showcased remarkable performances from players of different teams, culminating in a final between these two exceptional squads - a true celebration of cricket. ""I am sure spectators at Lord's, along with fans tuning in from all over the world, will be treated to some top-class cricket in this revered format when Australia and South Africa take the field less than a month from now. ""On behalf of the ICC, I extend best wishes to the players of both teams in their preparations for the prestigious match."" Both captains too looked forward enthusiastically to playing at Lord's, which hosts the WTC Final for the first time. Australian captain Pat Cummins said: ""We are enormously proud to have the opportunity to defend the World Test Championship, especially at Lord's. It's a testament to all those involved across the past two years who have worked incredibly hard to reach the final, which is a great honour for all of us. ""We very much look forward to getting together again in England in just a few weeks' time and the challenge South Africa will present at the home of cricket."" South African captain Temba Bavuma said: ""We're really pleased to have made the World Test Championship Final, which is a good opportunity for us to win an ICC title. ""Everyone understands the importance of Test cricket and the World Test Championship lends context to this vital format of the game. Lord's is a fitting venue for this mega fixture and all of us will be out there trying to give our best against Australia."" ""The anticipation is increasing with less than one month to go, and I am sure fans around the world would be following the fortunes of both teams come 11 June.""","Thu May 15, 2025 02:46 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 02:54 PM"

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) could also grant Shakib Al Hasan NOC to play for Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League (PSL).  The IPL is set to resume on May 17 after being suspended due to the recent India-Pakistan conflict. Delhi, who are fifth on the points table and are yet to confirm a playoff spot, are scheduled to play Gujarat Titans on May 18, Mumbai Indians on May 21, and Punjab Kings on May 24 in their final three league-phase matches.   Mustafizur, who was signed for the remainder of the IPL season by Delhi for INR 6 crore, had asked the BCB for NOC for Delhi's last three league matches.  ""Mustafizur has already been selected for the national team, and he has left for the UAE with the team [yesterday].

Barcelona are at the top of the table, four points ahead of Real Madrid with a game in hand, and can win their 28th LaLiga title if they beat Espanyol tonight. The only scenario in which Real still manage to win the league is if Barca go on to lose all three of their remaining matches -- away to Espanyol tonight, at home against Villarreal, and away to Athletic Club in the next two game weeks -- and Real win both of their remaining games -- away to Sevilla and at home against Real Sociedad. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti was happy to keep their slim hopes alive. ""We want to do our job, which is to win the next matches and see what happens. Our task today was not to give away the league. They'll have to play tomorrow [tonight]. Anything can happen in football. If they win, we'll congratulate them, and if they don't, we'll stay in the fight,"" Ancelotti said after a dramatic winner in the fifth minute of stoppage time from academy centre back Jacobo Ramon helped Real Madrid beat Mallorca yesterday. Ancelotti also heaped praise on his young players. ""We didn't give up despite having 12 players injured, something that is very rare,"" he said. ""The match was won thanks to a good attitude from the team and the players who came in and delivered a good performance. I've never seen a team shoot 40 times at goal like we did today. ""We have covered so many absentees with an extraordinary effort by all the players who did step foot on the pitch today. If we had done it in more games with this same attitude throughout the season, it would have been a better campaign."" Ancelotti confirmed on Monday that he would be leaving Real Madrid at the end of the season to take over the vacant Brazil national team job. The Italian, however, said his focus would remain in the Spanish capital until May 26, when he travels to Rio de Janeiro to start his new role with the five-time World Cup champions. ""Whenever I've sat on the Real Madrid bench at the Santiago Bernabeu it's always been special for me,"" Ancelotti said.

""Yamal is a pure, unique talent, a player who has proven to be different from the rest. He grew up in Barcelona's academy, where the 'Lionel Messi' identity is very present, so these kids copy that format,"" Trezeguet, a World Cup winner with France in 1998, told reporters. Mastantuono, River Plate's attacking midfielder who is making waves in Argentina, is ""demonstrating all his qualities at a very young age,"" Trezeguet added. Yamal is the youngest player to debut and score for Spain. With Barcelona, he has already won the Spanish league, the Copa del Rey, and the Spanish Super Cup. He also won the European Championship with Spain. Trezeguet, a former River Plate player, where Mastantuono made his debut in January last year, emphasised that both players ""are great to watch"" because of the way they play and the way they ""express their talent"". ""They'll have time to perfect everything else. They're young. But I think it's important for football in general to have this type of player who serves as an example for the younger players."" Juan Pablo Sorin, who played for both River Plate and Barcelona, said he would like to see both players continue their development. ""I don't like comparisons, because I think it's like limiting the player who's emerging. It's the same thing that happened to Lamine and Leo (Messi),"" the former Argentina defender told Reuters. ""It's true that the position is similar, but I think the characteristics are different, and I think each player has their own potential, qualities, and areas for improvement,"" he added. Both Trezeguet and Sorin said River Plate fans should make the most of Mastantuono's time there as he would likely continue his career in Europe soon. The Argentine, who has been linked with Real Madrid, shone in River Plate's victory over Boca Juniors last month, scoring a free kick. ""We have to let them complete all the stages. They have to play, have fun, and continue to show off their talent and their audacity. They have a lot of personality,"" Sorin said. ""What really catches my attention about both of them is how effective they are with the number of balls they touch. They make most of them effective, and that's impressive for their age,"" he added.","Thu May 15, 2025 10:02 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 10:05 AM"

The 65-year-old Ancelotti, one of the most decorated managers in world football, will become Brazil coach after leaving Real Madrid at the end of the season. He became the first manager to capture titles in each of Europe's top five leagues, for England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France, and has guided Real to two Champions League and LaLiga doubles in three seasons. ""I'm very happy, and I can't believe there's anyone who isn't happy when the arrival of the best coach in the world is announced,"" Felipe Melo, a three-time Copa Libertadores winner and World Cup player with Brazil in 2010, told reporters. Since Tite left the job in late 2022, Ramon Menezes, Fernando Diniz, and Dorival Jr. have been in charge of the team. ""If we changed four coaches in less than three years, something isn't working (...) In my opinion, Ancelotti was brought in to get results, so we have to help him,"" said Dunga, a World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994 and former coach of the national team. Brazil is in fourth place in CONMEBOL as it seeks to qualify for the 2026 World Cup having won only six of 14 matches. Six teams will qualify for next year's World Cup. ""He has a broader vision of the different football schools around the world, and I think that's a great asset,"" said Mauro Silva, a World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994. ""It's a delicate moment for Brazilian football. We have some structural issues, but all in all, I hope Ancelotti succeeds."" Former soccer player Formiga, who holds the record for having played in seven Women World Cups and seven Olympic Games with Brazil, hoped that Ancelotti would have a quick ""connection"" with the team so they could reach the World Cup without any problems. ""He doesn't have much time, but I hope he and his coaching staff and the players can help each other as much as possible (...) You have to have the spirit and discipline to change everything that's happening today; we have to believe it's possible"". The former players also addressed the words of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who a few days ago criticised the current Brazil international players, saying that they aren't at the same level than others from the past and are ""very far"" from the great teams. When asked by Reuters, Mauro Silva said: ""I think what's happening is that everyone in Brazil misses winning titles, right? Now, by 2026, it will be 24 years since we've won a World Cup. Everyone is sad and hoping Brazil wins something."" Brazil won its fifth World Cup title in 2002, but has since experienced countless disappointments, including failing to lift the Cup at home in 2014. ""We miss the spirit we had before, of those who did so much for football, and that we don't have today (...) So it's fair to mention these players and say that this new generation should reflect their history,"" she added.","Thu May 15, 2025 09:38 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 09:42 AM"
"Sports","https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/football/news/wasting-golden-generation-3894916","Wasting a golden generation?","When Bangladesh clinched their second straight SAFF Women's Championship title in October 2024, it felt like a turning point -- a sign the team were ready to move beyond South Asian dominance and step onto a larger Asian stage. Seven months later, that hope is dimming fast, giving way to uncertainty and increasing skepticism. Calls to raise the bar -- to arrange matches against stronger second-tier Asian nations like Vietnam, Thailand, Iran, and the Philippines -- were loud and clear after the SAFF success. Yet little action followed. Infrastructure remains stagnant. Facilities haven't improved. And more worryingly, even the existing resources are being mishandled. The root of the current crisis is a deepening rift between head coach Peter Butler and a group of senior players. That fallout, which began with a training boycott in January, continues to overshadow preparations for the upcoming fixtures in Myanmar, Bahrain and Turkmenistan in AFC Women's Asian Cup qualifiers in June and July. Despite Bangladesh Football Federation's (BFF) efforts at crisis management, the cracks are widening. Butler -- a former Premier League player with a respectable coaching record -- is back at the helm with eight of the boycotting players reintegrated. Ten others, however, including national stalwarts like Sabina Khatun, Maria Manda, Monica Chakma, are currently playing in Bhutan's Women's League -- just when the national team needs unity the most. Playing abroad offers valuable exposure, especially given the limited international opportunities at home. Still, it's hard to ignore the timing. Shouldn't preparing for a crucial international campaign take precedence? The episode exposes deeper problems. Bangladesh women's football now stands at a crossroads -- between building on progress and watching it unravel. The decision to let core players drift away without resolving internal disputes signals a worrying lack of leadership and strategic thinking. Coach Butler has described the current squad as the ""future"" of Bangladesh. And while the younger players do show promise, pushing aside seasoned internationals without a clear transition plan risks derailing the momentum built over the past decade. Players like Maria, Monica, and Sabina have carried Bangladesh through its rise since 2014, facing elite youth sides from Japan, Korea, and Australia. Their experience is irreplaceable. Yet, instead of bridging the gap and restoring trust, the federation's inaction has only deepened the divide. Seven months into the tenure of the Tabith Awal-led executive committee, women's football remains without a functioning domestic structure. Beyond short-term contracts for 54 players, there are no meaningful pathways, leaving the sport's foundation increasingly fragile. Unless reconciliation happens -- unless Butler and the BFF work to reintegrate the veterans and unify the squad -- Bangladesh could head into the Asian qualifiers fractured, underprepared, and at risk of squandering hard-won momentum. This is not just about picking sides. It's about safeguarding potential, preserving continuity, and respecting the journey that brought the team to this point. Without belief, trust, and structure, even the brightest promise can collapse under its own weight.  ","Thu May 15, 2025 09:30 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 10:46 AM"

Los Blancos cut the gap on the Catalan giants to four points ahead of Barcelona's visit to neighbours Espanyol on Thursday, where they can wrap up the title with a victory. Trailing for much of the game after Martin Valjent's 11th-minute opener, two second-half goals for Madrid ensured their arch-rivals did not claim their 28th La Liga title just yet. Madrid needed to win to deny Barca and Kylian Mbappe's equaliser and Jacobo Ramon's 95th-minute strike allowed them to do just that. Los Blancos' defeat by Barcelona on Sunday in the Clasico left the Catalans on the brink of the title but Carlo Ancelotti's side showed fighting spirit in the final stages against Mallorca. Madrid coach Ancelotti is departing to take charge of the Brazilian national team at the end of a disappointing season in the Spanish capital, and has two games left in his post. The Italian's Madrid side, riddled with injury problems, were without Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes among other star names as Mallorca visited the Santiago Bernabeu. The islanders, ninth, are hoping for European football for the first time since 2004 and put up a strong performance. Madrid's 18-year-old striker Endrick, whom Ancelotti may call up for Brazil in the future, came close early on but Leo Roman tipped his effort away. Mallorca took an early lead when Valjent received the ball on the right of the box in an ocean of space. The defender took his shot early and beat Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, making his 200th La Liga appearance. Roman made a fine save to thwart England international Jude Bellingham as Madrid pushed for an equaliser. The stopper, who also excelled for Mallorca in a recent narrow defeat at Barcelona, denied Mbappe and then Fede Valverde before the break. Eventually, Mbappe found a breakthrough for Madrid after 68 minutes, with some superb footwork to escape three Mallorca players trying to shut him down, and he drilled past Roman. It was Mbappe's 40th goal of a productive season on a personal level, although his team are set to end it without a major trophy and having been beaten four times by Barcelona across all competitions. Mateu Morey should have put Mallorca back ahead almost instantly after a Jacobo error, but Courtois denied him one-on-one. Roman produced yet another fine save from Arda Guler's drive before Valjent headed Mbappe's effort off the line and to safety with the goalkeeper out of position. It looked like, despite Madrid's efforts, they were not going to find a winner, but 20-year-old defender Jacobo lifted a dropping ball over Roman's head as the Mallorca defence hesitated.","Thu May 15, 2025 03:42 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 03:47 AM"

Dan Ndoye scored the goal in the 53rd minute which gave Bologna a historic victory, their first honour since last winning the cup in 1974. Bologna hadn't even been in a major tournament final since last winning the Italian Cup -- the second of their two domestic cup triumphs. But coach Vincenzo Italiano has a done a brilliant job since arriving to replace Thiago Motta at Bologna, who have won the Italian championship seven times but last did so in 1964. Wednesday's victory was also Italiano's first major honour as a coach as he lost three finals with his previous club Fiorentina, including the 2023 Italian Cup final. Italiano was held aloft by his jubilant players as Bologna fans danced and cried in the Stadio Olimpico stands after seeing what many thought they'd never see. Milan were crowned European champions the same season they last won the cup in 2003, a different time for a club once owned by deceased former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Rivals Inter Milan are in the Champions League final and trying to retain their Serie A title while Milan are in battle to qualify for Europe after missing out on the cup. Sergio Conceicao's team sit eighth in Serie A, three points behind Roma who sit in the Conference League spot and host Milan on Sunday. Santiago Castro had the first chance of the game for Bologna in the eighth minute but failed to get enough on a vicious inswinging free-kick to divert it past Mike Maignan, who was already committed in the Milan goal. Bologna survived a huge scare moments later when Alex Jimenez got down the right and drilled in a low cross which Sam Beukema diverted straight at his goalkeeper Lukasz Skorupski, who was then lucky enough for Luka Jovic to smash the rebound right down his throat. The match became a more tense affair after that, and it wasn't until Ndoye's winner that either team had another opportunity, the Switzerland attacker shimmying and lashing home after Riccardo Orsolini was tackled in the penalty area by Theo Hernandez. Milan have been comeback specialists this season, including when beating Bologna 3-1 in the league last weekend. But they only mustered up one other chance of note in the 71st minute, when substitute Santiago Gimenez's dreadful first touch effectively passed Hernandez's low cross to Skorupski. Bologna successfully, if somewhat awkwardly, hacked away Milan's limp attempts to attack, and collapsed to the ground in exhaustion once referee Maurizio Mariani blew the final whistle.","Thu May 15, 2025 03:33 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 03:39 AM"

Victory in Bilbao on May 21 will hand a lifeline to one of the struggling English giants by propelling them directly into the lucrative league phase of next season's Champions League. United and Tottenham sit just outside the Premier League relegation zone and the loser will miss out on European competition entirely next season. A return to Europe's elite tournament is estimated to be worth at least £70 million ($93 million) to United and would allow Amorim more resources to rebuild his squad. ""For me the Champions League is more important,"" Amorim said at a press conference on Wednesday. ""For everything, to prepare the next season. ""We are supposed to be in the Champions League. Europa League here is not enough and you have to have that feeling here. ""The best way to help us to get to the top in a few years is the Champions League. It is not the title, the trophy. ""The most important thing is how this title could help us to get back to the top faster."" A dramatic run to the final has salvaged a torrid start to Amorim's time at Old Trafford. Since taking charge in November, he has won just six of 25 Premier League games. The Portuguese coach has at times been brutal in the assessment of his team, including labelling them the worst in the club's history. However, he rejected suggestions he could resign if United compound a miserable season with defeat in Spain. ""I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and see nothing and not take the responsibility,"" added Amorim. ""It's just that I have a clear idea of what to do. I understand the problems of the team, so I'm far from quitting. ""What I'm saying is that we need to perform. In the future we need to perform or else they will change us."" Amorim confirmed reports that he will help fund travel for the families of his backroom staff to the final. United have made swingeing cuts off the field in the year since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe bought a minority stake in the club, including 250 redundancies with up to 200 more to come. Amorim said that negativity has played a part in United's struggles this season but the Europa League offers the chance for a much-needed boost. ""This season has been really tough on everybody. The results and also the changes in the staff. You can feel it in our club. ""We had so many bad results in the Premier League, so the environment is tough at the moment.

Renowned for his eclectic blend of pop, electronic, and traditional Bangladeshi sounds, Pritom Hasan is set to embark on his much-anticipated ""USA Tour 2025"".  Organised by Deshi Music & Entertainment, the tour will see Pritom perform across multiple cities in the United States and Canada. The journey kicks off on May 31 in Dallas, Texas, and includes performances in Miami, New York, San Jose, Portland, Paterson, Toronto, Montreal, Boston, Los Angeles, Houston, Washington DC, Detroit, Atlanta, and Buffalo.  Pritom's dynamic stage presence and genre-defying music have garnered him a dedicated fanbase both at home and abroad. His recent announcement has already sparked excitement among fans, with advance ticket sales underway for several concerts. Following the Eid-ul-Azha celebrations, acclaimed singer Sania Sultana Liza is set to captivate European audiences with her melodious voice. Her tour commences on June 22 in Paris, France, and will continue through Belgium, Switzerland, and Spain.  Notably, on June 29, Liza will perform at the Boishakhi Utsab in Liège, Belgium, organised by the Belgo Bangla Cultural Association, alongside artistes Rahul Anand and Sagar Baul. Subsequent performances are scheduled for July 5 in Zurich, Switzerland, and July 12 in Barcelona, Spain. Liza, who rose to fame after winning the musical reality show ""Close Up-1"" in 2008, has since become a household name in Bangladesh. Her upcoming European tour marks another milestone in her illustrious career.","Sun May 18, 2025 05:46 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 05:52 PM"

Following the arrest, Cultural affairs adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki addressed the issue in a Facebook post.  In his post, Farooki expressed concern over the arrest and questioned the authorities' handling of the situation. 
 ""I generally try not to speak beyond the responsibilities of my ministry. But I do have an identity—I was a part of this industry and will be returning to it. The arrest of Nusraat Faria has become an awkward incident for us,"" said Farooki. ""It is the responsibility of our government to bring actual offenders from the July case to justice. When it comes to blanket cases, our stance is clear: no one will be arrested without a preliminary investigation indicating involvement. And that policy was being followed,"" he added. Farooki noted that although a case had existed against Faria for some time, there had been no apparent move by the government to arrest her prior to the conclusion of the investigation. ""But the incident occurred right after she arrived at the airport,"" he remarked.  He also drew connections between the timing of the arrest and recent political tensions, particularly public reaction to former Awami League president Abdul Hamid's travel abroad. ""Perhaps this incident resulted from over-nervousness or frustration. A few days ago, a similar incident happened with the wife of Barrister Andaleeve Partha. Such incidents are in no way justifiable,"" he said. Farooki expressed hope that Faria would receive appropriate legal recourse. He concluded his statement by urging more sensitivity in handling sweeping legal cases. ""And we hope to be able to handle such blanket cases with greater sensitivity. We must remember that our primary task is to bring the actual offenders of the July incident to justice,"" he wrote. A Dhaka court today sent Nusraat Faria to jail in connection with an attempted murder case linked to the July uprising.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:06 PM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 01:18 PM"

Organised by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in partnership with the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), the exhibition aims to shed light on the vital yet often overlooked world of childcare services in Bangladesh, especially in the context of a growing female workforce. As more women join the country's labor force, the demand for accessible and reliable childcare is rapidly increasing. The exhibition explores the diversity of childcare models currently in practice, ranging from formal centers to informal community-based setups, and presents powerful visuals of childcare workers and the families they support. Through Hasan's lens, the exhibition captures the everyday realities of childcare providers: their dedication, challenges, and the working conditions that often lack standardisation in terms of hours, pay, safety, and access to social protections. The images also highlight the role childcare plays in enabling working parents, particularly mothers, to pursue employment while ensuring their children receive adequate care. Organisers hope the exhibition will initiate conversations about the professionalisation of childcare work and emphasise the need for fair labor conditions in this essential sector. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to attend and engage with the narratives of those who are helping to shape a more inclusive and equitable workforce in Bangladesh.","Sun May 18, 2025 09:08 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 09:18 PM"

Pascal, known for his outspoken nature, responded to a question on political filmmaking by highlighting the urgency of storytelling in the face of fear-driven politics.  Referencing the climate under Trump's presidency, he said, ""Fear is the way they win. So, keep telling the stories. Keep expressing yourself and keep fighting to be who you are. Defy the people who try to make you scared… And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so in telling stories. And don't let them win."" Although he admitted feeling daunted by the gravity of the subject, saying, ""It's far too intimidating a question for me to really address, I'm not informed enough,"" Pascal's comments rang with personal truth. He then reflected on his family's past, one marked by political exile and survival. ""I want people to be safe and to be protected, and I want very much to live on the right [side of] history,"" he said.  ""I'm an immigrant. My parents are refugees from Chile. We fled a dictatorship, and I was privileged enough to grow up in the US after asylum in Denmark. If it weren't for that, I don't know what would have happened to us. I stand by those protections. I'm too afraid of your question. I hardly remember what it was."" Pascal's remarks come at a time when immigration is once again a heated political flashpoint in the US. This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new measure that would pay undocumented migrants $1,000 and offer them travel assistance to voluntarily return to their countries. The initiative is part of a broader crackdown reinstated by Trump during his second term, which includes stricter border enforcement and a slate of executive orders focused on detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. With ""Eddington"" itself reportedly tackling themes of isolation and absurdity during the pandemic era, Pascal's remarks blurred the line between the political and the personal, reminding audiences that storytelling is often the first act of resistance.","Sun May 18, 2025 05:31 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 05:44 PM"
"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/dola-does-it-again-3884066","Dola does it again","Some songs don't just trend—they take over. One such track is ""Chand Mama"", from the film ""Borbaad"", which didn't just climb the YouTube Music trending list once, but soared to the top twice and is still continuing to evoke emotions even after a month. With superstar Shakib Khan and Nusrat Jahan lighting up the screen, the infectious energy of ""Chand Mama"" comes from the creative mind of the multi-talented Pritom Hasan, who not only composed the track but also performed in it. Joining him in this high-energy number is the vibrant voice of Aditi Rahman Dola, whose performance has earned widespread praise and firmly placed her in the spotlight. ""The feeling is surreal! It's been a month now, and it's still trending. This is beyond an artiste can ask for, that people have been showering love upon us,"" shared that singer who is trained in semi-classical and belongs to a musical family. A bona fide party anthem, the song became the soundtrack of Eid celebrations across the country — from rooftop parties to bustling streets. ""Usually, a song trends for a day or maybe a week or two, but this has been going strong for over a month — that's huge!"" shares an excited Dola. ""Interestingly, when the song first started climbing the charts, I kept checking out of excitement,"" Dola shares. ""Since many Eid songs were trending then, I was curious to see how ours was doing. At one point, I checked Pritom's channel and saw our song at number two—I felt a little disappointed. But when I looked to see what was at number one, I was shocked—it was ""Chand Mama"" again, just uploaded from a different channel! It was an incredible feeling. It's so rare for the same song to trend from two different sources."" As Dola is also a lawyer and full-time HC practitioner, the excitement around her song extends well beyond the music scene. ""I can't explain in words how exciting and amazing it is. Each time I meet a colleague—be it a lawyer, staff member, or even clients—they keep appreciating me for the song. The fun part is, once my opposition lawyer, after a hearing, came over and congratulated me and gave positive feedback. It was such a unique and wonderful experience!"" she laughed. She also mentioned that her colleagues had gone to the cinema to watch ""Borbaad"" because of her song. ""Every day, I'm having a new experience, and I'm enjoying every bit of it!"" While Dola and Pritom had previously collaborated on the romantic number ""Jani Tumi Chhile"" from the film ""Mission Extreme"", which was composed by Adit Rahman, ""Chand Mama"" marked the first time she lent her voice to a composition by Pritom himself. ""We've known each other for a long time, and Pritom is like a little brother to me. Everyone knows there's only one Pritom Hasan and how talented he is. He told me this was the right time—he felt my voice would be the perfect fit for this song. He's very particular about what he wants, and gave me clear direction on how to deliver it,"" she said. ""During the recording he gave me very specific guidance—it needed to be simple, but with a seductive edge–sharing that the song was for the film ""Borbaad"", and that Shakib Khan and Nusrat Jahan would be featured on screen."" After recording the song, both Dola and Pritom had an instinctive feeling that they had created something special. ""We both had that vibe even before it was mixed—that we'd made something that would really click,"" and their instincts proved right. Sharing about other songs from Eid films that caught her ear, Dola said, ""I really liked 'Bondhugo Shono', tuned by Prince Mahmud (voiced by Imran Mahmudul and Dilshad Nahar Kona). It's a beautiful song. I also loved 'Nisshash' (voiced and tuned by GM Ashraf), and 'Didha' (voiced and tuned by Pritom Hasan) —the other tracks from 'Borbaad' ."" Referring to Shakib Khan as her lucky charm, Dola fondly recalled her playback debut in ""Tumi Chara"" from the film ""Rajotto"" (featuring Shakib Khan and Eamin Haque Bobby), released a decade ago. ""For any artiste, Shakib Khan is a lucky charm,"" she shared. ""People still remember me from that debut. And now, ten years later, to sing 'Chand Mama'—again in one of his films—feels incredibly special. I feel so fortunate that I've had the chance to sing in his films."" As for what's next, Dola has an exciting lineup ahead, which includes collaborations with emerging artistes, new semi-classical experiments with the Aditarians, film songs in the next big Eid release.","Sat May 3, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sat May 3, 2025 12:00 AM"
"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/xefer-owning-it-3869256","Xefer owning it","This Eid, Xefer Rahman surprised fans not just with new music, but also with her return to acting. After her debut in Mostofa Sarwar Farooki's ""Monogamy"", she appeared in the highly anticipated web-series ""Myself Allen Swapan 2"", directed by Shihab Shaheen. She not only shared the screen with Nasir Uddin Khan but also lent her voice to the series with the track ""Boyam Pakhi 2.0"". Simultaneously, her song ""Niye Jabe Ki"" from the Eid film ""Daagi"" was added to the festive lineup. How did you find yourself joining the cast of 'Myself Allen Swapan 2'? It all started when Shihab bhai and I had a meeting for the song in ""Daagi"". During our conversation, he mentioned that he was considering me for a role in his upcoming web-series. At that point, I didn't know which role I would play or what the project was about. Once I learned more, it was hard to say no. Shihab Shaheen is known for his skilled craft, and ""Myself Allen Swapan"" already has a massive fan base. I also wanted to take on roles that would help shape my acting career, which is one of the main reasons I joined the team. How was your experience sharing the screen with Nasir Uddin Khan?
 I had previously worked with Nasir bhai on ""No Dorai"", where I was the executive producer. Back then, he wasn't as popular as he is now, and OTTs weren't popular in Bangladesh. He has this rare quality—wherever he goes, he stands out. This time around, working with him as a co-actor was inspiring, and I was particularly moved when he said that we would both ""give it our all, together"" during our scenes. Tell us about your song 'Niye Jabe Ki' from 'Daagi'. Many people think I'm only a vocalist—mostly because I'm a woman—and they often overlook the fact that I compose as well. It is something that triggers me. In most cases, whenever you hear me sing a song, it's likely one I've composed myself. When I spoke to Shihab bhai, I told him the same thing and added that I'd like him to use a song I composed. What touched me most was that during the shoot, the cast and crew would listen to the demo of my composition. Later, I co-wrote the lyrics with Badhon based on the plot of the film and completed the track. Though people know me better for ""Jhumka"", I want to make more melodious songs as this genre has been close to my heart since childhood. ""Niye Jabe Ki"" was released with the film's theatrical debut, and now that it's out on all platforms, people have been searching for it. That is incredibly fulfilling for me. You not only voiced but appeared in the song 'Boyam Pakhi 2.0'. What was the experience like?
 The previous version was already popular, but it had only the male perspective. Now, with my voice added, it includes a female perspective, which I think adds depth and relatability—especially for female listeners. That's what makes it beautiful. Also, I believe my voice and appearance added extra strength to it! You started your career with English songs and became popular for your covers. Any plans to return to English releases? Absolutely. My journey began with English songs, and I also compose in English. Last year, I released ""Spicy"", which was in English, though, ironically, the Bengali part—""Sona Bondhu Tui Amare""—went viral! (laughs) This year, most of my song releases will be in Bangla, but I plan to keep nurturing my English catalogue as well. I'm also thinking of converting some of the Bengali songs that the audience loves, into English versions. This Eid-ul-Fitr saw several film songs become popular. Aside from your own, which ones stood out to you?
 Definitely ""Chand Mama"" by Pritom Hasan from the film ""Borbaad"". I also really like ""Ektukhaani Mon"" by Tahsan Khan and Masha from ""Daagi"". I'm happy that all five films released during Eid had a good response. If we keep up this momentum, our industry will continue to grow—and that includes the music scene as well. Since your acting debut, your appearance has changed dramatically. Do you miss your previous look? Honestly, no. I carried that look for a long time. I can always go back to it if I want, but right now, I'm enjoying the change. Since I'm acting alongside making music, I don't want to be tied to one look. ","Sat Apr 12, 2025 10:00 AM         Last update on: Sat Apr 12, 2025 04:24 PM"
"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/bangladeshs-ahassan-uddin-features-french-movie-3851596","Bangladesh’s Ahassan Uddin features in French movie","From the bustling streets of Paris to the silver screen, Ahassan Uddin's journey is a cinematic dream come true. The Bangladeshi native stars in the recently premiered French film ""Délocalisés,"" gracing the poster as Rahul Kool, an Indian worker, in his remarkable debut. ""We moved to Paris in 1994 because my father dreamed of giving us a better life abroad. It's been almost 40 years, but I'm happy I've been able to visit Bangladesh a few times and connect with my relatives,"" shared Ahassan. Life as an immigrant in Paris presented challenges. ""People would often look at you as if you didn't belong. I experienced bullying in school, but over time, I made friends."" That feeling of being an outsider left an indelible mark. Learning French came naturally since he started at the age of four; had he been older, it would have been much harder. Ahassan's path to acting began unexpectedly with modeling. ""In 2023, I participated in the Mr. Franco Desi contest, featuring participants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. I won the title, and soon after, I started receiving offers for ramp shows,"" he revealed. Initially disinterested, he joined primarily for the talent segment, eager to showcase his passion for dance. ""Dancing is something I'm passionate about, and when I saw that I'd have a platform to showcase it, I thought, why not?"" His success in modeling and his passion for dance led him to an unexpected opportunity. ""A friend told me about the audition for 'Délocalisés.' They advertised the casting on Facebook and Instagram, and my friend gave me the address. I knew how difficult it was for South Asian actors to get major roles in France, but I thought I'd give it a try. I took my ramp show photos and went there with zero expectations,"" he said. At the audition, amidst 200 candidates, Ahassan's talent shone through. ""I had no idea my role would be so significant. I thought it was a minor part. Honestly, if I had known how important the character was, I probably wouldn't have been able to perform as well,"" he admitted. Director Ali Bougheraba saw something special in Ahassan, a raw talent that resonated with the character of Rahul. However, the production team, concerned about his lack of experience, voiced their reservations. ""He has no experience. This is his first audition. Are you sure you want to cast him?"" they argued. Ultimately, his performance in a subsequent audition convinced the team he was perfect for the role. Ahassan's childhood love for Bollywood films, sparked by his uncles' DVDs, not only fueled his passion for dance but also helped him learn Hindi, simplifying his portrayal of Rahul. ""Délocalisés"" follows Redouane Mahrez (Redouane Bougheraba), promised a managerial position, who follows his company to India. There, he meets Rahul, a translator and mediator between him and the Indian workers. ""The most challenging scene was when I had to convince Redouane that I was on his side while secretly siding with the workers,"" Ahassan revealed. ""In that scene, I had to slap the main character. I accidentally slapped him hard, and the reaction you see in the movie is genuine!"" he laughed. Filming took nearly a year, with 44 days in India and 13 in Paris, coincidentally during Ramadan in Kolkata's 44-degree heat. ""If you watch closely, you'll notice I look healthier at the beginning of the film. By the end, I appear skinnier due to fasting,"" Ahassan shared. In a landscape where South Asian representation in French cinema is limited, Ahassan's role in ""Délocalisés"" is a significant milestone. ""I would love to work in Bollywood, Bangladeshi films, or any other exciting projects. Becoming an actor has always been my dream. If I can continue on this path, that would be the best thing for me,"" he concluded. With ""Délocalisés"" now in theaters, Ahassan Uddin's journey has just begun. He carries the hopes of aspiring South Asian actors, and his dream of bridging cultures through cinema is now a tangible reality. ","Wed Mar 19, 2025 08:10 AM         Last update on: Wed Mar 19, 2025 08:10 AM"

Starting out as a model, he made his acting debut in Vicky Zahed's ""Ararat"" (2024), portraying a jinn—a performance that caught the people's attention. His latest release, ""Neel Shukh"", has taken him even further, proving that he's here to stay. Hailing from Tangail, Rehan moved to Dhaka for his education. Like many newcomers to the city, he had to hustle—tutoring and working in restaurants to make ends meet. ""In 2017, when I first came to Dhaka, I was just another outsider trying to find a way in,"" Rehan shared. ""I always wanted to work in the fashion industry, and one day, out of nowhere, I got an offer through social media. It felt almost unreal."" Just like that, his entry into acting was just as spontaneous. ""I got a call from Vicky bhai's team offering me a role in his web project. Honestly, I thought it was a prank. I mean, I was a fan of his work, so I thought, 'Why would he even know me?' Then they called again and said that Vicky bhai wanted to meet me. Even then, I wasn't sure if it was real!"" Rehan went on to work in Mizanur Rahman Aryan's ""Jugol"" (2024), a romantic fiction where he starred opposite Naznin Niha. ""I've been really lucky,"" he admitted. ""As someone who is still learning, I had the chance to work with some of the best directors in the industry fairly early. I'd love to work with Ashfaque Nipun, Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, and emerging talents like Jahid Preetom in the future."" ""When I got into acting, I knew I didn't want to take on just any project—I wanted to do something different, something that would stand out."" His debut role as a jinn was no easy feat. ""That character was actually tough to play, especially as my first role. Then again, when people still recognise me for it, I feel like all the struggles were worth it. Vicky bhai believed in me at a time when I didn't even believe in myself, and I'll always be grateful for that."" Rehan's latest project, ""Neel Shukh"", was another step in the right direction. ""Vicky bhai's way of storytelling is different; he always pushes boundaries. This time, he straight up cautioned me, 'You're going to face challenges, so be ready for them!'"" This project gave him more screen time with Mehazabien Chowdhury, and he couldn't have asked for a better co-star. ""She helped me a lot. We rehearsed together and built great synchronisation between our characters. She's an incredible co-actor,"" he expressed.  ""Something our director told me that really stuck with me is, 'When you have a strong co-actor, you have no choice but to give your best shot because the camera catches everything.'"" Currently pursuing an MBA at the University of Dhaka, Rehan is juggling academics, fashion collaborations, commercials, and acting. ""I don't intend to rush into projects. As a newcomer, I've received so much love and support that I am immensely grateful for it all. However, I also know I make mistakes, and I'm trying to learn and improve with each new opportunity,"" he said. For the upcoming Eid, he's in talks to star in several projects but is being careful about his choices. ""I don't want to disappoint the audience. The next time they see me on screen, I want them to feel the same excitement they felt when they first saw me in 'Ararat', 'Jugol', or 'Neel Shukh',"" concluded the actor. ","Sat Mar 15, 2025 12:00 AM         Last update on: Sat Mar 15, 2025 12:00 AM"

Shakib Khan and several others are shown wearing it, though the reason behind it remains undisclosed — a mystery that will unfold in the full film. Director Raihan Rafi remains tight-lipped, only saying, ""We're calling this a forecast — like a storm warning — because 'Taandob' is about to break loose.

Premiering in the competition section, the psychological drama received a six-minute standing ovation following its screening. Overcome with emotion, Ramsay briefly addressed the audience before hastily exiting the venue. ""Wow. I'm so overwhelmed. Thanks to these amazing actors. I've got to get it together, I'll see you in a minute,"" she said, running up the aisle of the Palais. Based on Ariana Harwicz's 2017 novel ""Die, My Love"", the film delves into the psychological descent of a new mother grappling with postpartum depression. Lawrence delivers a visceral performance as the protagonist, with Pattinson playing her husband.  Their volatile relationship unfolds through intense confrontations, with the film featuring jarring scenes of self-inflicted violence. The supporting cast includes LaKeith Stanfield, Sissy Spacek, and Nick Nolte. ""Die, My Love"" marks Ramsay's return to Cannes after eight years. The filmmaker's longstanding relationship with the festival includes her debut ""Ratcatcher"" (1999) in Un Certain Regard, ""Movern Callar"" (2002) in Directors' Fortnight, and competition titles like ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" (2011) and ""You Were Never Really Here"" (2017)—the latter winning Best Screenplay and Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix. Lawrence, who also serves as a producer on ""Die, My Love"", previously attended Cannes in 2023 for the documentary ""Bread and Roses"". While she has had festival appearances at Venice (""mother!"") and TIFF (""Silver Linings Playbook""), this marks her first film in competition at Cannes.  Pattinson, meanwhile, continues his strong presence at the festival with previous entries including ""Good Time"", ""Maps to the Stars"", and ""The Lighthouse"".","Sun May 18, 2025 11:12 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 11:17 AM"

Amid political unrest, torrential rain, and unexpected public reactions, the team behind this genre-bending web series had to fight tooth and nail to bring it to life. Actress Nishat Priom, who plays Annie Rozario, shares an inside look at what went into the making of the project. ""We were filming right in the middle of the July unrest,"" she recalls. ""There were gunshots, all sorts of chaos and disturbances going on, and yet we continued shooting amidst it all."" At times, the cast and crew had to stay up all night keeping watch for dakats (robbers), only to report back on set early the next morning. ""Those sleepless nights are moments the entire team will never forget,"" she adds. Directed by Asif Chowdhury and co-written by Neamoth Ullah Masum and Ahammad Saad, ""Fyakra"" premiered on Bongo on May 8, bringing together a compelling mix of thriller, romance, horror, and family drama. According to Priom, ""This is a multidimensional genre work. It can't be classified under a single label."" The story revolves primarily around Annie (played by Priom) and Golapi (played by Nidra). Annie is a Christian woman who marries a Muslim man, Ashfaque (played by Shamol Mawla). ""Annie sacrifices everything to marry Ashfaque, including her family,"" says Priom. ""So, at any cost, she wants to keep her marriage alive."" But constant emotional distance and unfulfilled expectations weigh heavily on their relationship, until one life-altering incident related to Golapi and Samad (played by Partho Sheikh) turns everything upside down. The chaos wasn't just limited to on-screen drama. Partho, Mir Rabbi, and Abdullal Al Sentu, dressed in full underworld get-up and carrying prop guns, once caused panic in a neighbourhood after shooting wrapped up. ""People thought they were real dacoits and attacked their car with sticks,"" Priom laughs. ""They had to convince everyone they were just actors. It is one of the instances of such real 'Fyakra' that the entire team had to go through."" While the official shoot took 15 days, it took nearly two months to wrap the project. Delays caused by rain were frequent. ""There were days when we returned home at 5am with just being able to finish only half of a single scene,"" she says. With a diverse set of six–seven protagonists from all walks of life, ""Fyakra"" promises relatability for viewers across generations. ""The entire team was totally invested—both literally and emotionally,"" Priom signs off with a smile.","Sun May 18, 2025 09:00 AM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 09:00 AM"

After a seven-year break, Lux Superstar is making a comeback, with the registration process already underway. The show first premiered in 2005, with Shanarei Devi Shanu crowned the winner of the debut season. In the following years, the platform introduced several now-prominent stars to the spotlight, including Mamo, Afsan Ara Bindu, Badhan, Mim, Mehazabien, and Mousumi Hamid. Participation in the show proved to be a turning point for many, propelling them into successful careers across television, film, and advertising. Although Lux Superstar ran consistently until 2010, the show experienced irregularity afterward. It briefly returned in 2012 following a one-year pause, only to go on another two-year hiatus. After the 2014 season, the break extended to four years. The last competition was held in 2018, where Mim Mantasha was declared the winner. Since then, the show has remained dormant until this year. The reality show's official registration opened on May 6. Aspiring female contestants between 18 and 27 years old are eligible to apply. Interested participants can register by completing a form through a link posted on the Lux Bangladesh Facebook page. However, reflecting changing trends and shifting industry needs, the competition has adopted a new format. In addition to judging acting and styling skills, the selection criteria now include an assessment of participants' content creation capabilities. This year's edition brings on board a high-profile team that includes acclaimed actress Jaya Ahsan, popular star Mehazabien Chowdhury, and noted filmmaker Raihan Rafi. This announcement was made through a promotional video released on Lux's official Facebook page. In that video, Mehazabien reflects on her own experience, saying, ""When I registered for Lux Superstar back in 2009, I was honestly quite nervous. It was a huge platform, and presenting myself before so many influential figures felt daunting. But it's this very platform that gave me the confidence to reach where I am today. I'll be supporting the contestants this time, from start to finish."" The promotional video also includes appearances by other familiar faces such as Bidya Sinha Mim, Ishrat Zaheen, Mumtaheena Chowdhury Toya, and Neelanjona Neela.

"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/music/news/chirkutt-returns-new-album-bhalobashashomogro-3892906","Chirkutt returns with new album ‘Bhalobashashomogro’","After years of internal reshuffling, beloved Bangladeshi band Chirkutt has made a powerful comeback with their fourth studio album, ""Bhalobashashomogro"". For the past few years, Chirkutt had been navigating a period of major changes. Two years ago, guitarist and composer Emon Chowdhury left the group, followed by Jahid Nirob's departure last year. Drummer and music producer Pavel Areen also shifted his focus more toward his solo career.  However, none of it has slowed down Chirkutt's heartbeat. Led by the band's founder and vocalist Sharmin Sultana Sumi, Chirkutt continues to move forward with new members and renewed energy. Nearly two decades into their musical journey, Chirkutt has surprisingly only released three albums so far. Two years ago, they teased fans with the announcement of a new album titled ""Pendulum"".  However, that project evolved into something deeper — and yesterday, the first song from their newly-titled album ""Bhalobashashomogro"" finally dropped.  The track, ""Dami"", is now available with a music video on the band's official YouTube channel. ""Bhalobashashomogro"" features ten tracks in total. Alongside ""Dami"", the album includes songs titled ""Uttore Bhalo Na"", ""Daak"", ""Agun"", ""Hiya"", ""Mon Keno Dilen Na"", ""Oshukh Shere Jay"", ""Bhalobashi Tomay"", ""Dorodi"", and ""Din Jay"".  Three tracks will be released as full-fledged music videos, while the rest will be accompanied by lyrical videos. All songs are set to be released within this week. Speaking about the album's title, Sumi shared, ""From what I have seen of this world, love is the greatest energy. Without love, we have nothing to say, nothing to do. Love should be the language of our songs. That's why we named the album 'Bhalobashashomogro'."" ""Love isn't just about romance; it's universal. Every song reflects a different shade of love. Everyone contributed to the making of this album — after countless discussions, this is what we created,"" she concluded.  At a time when most bands prefer releasing singles rather than full albums to stay afloat in the age of streaming, Chirkutt chose to walk their own path. A full set of ten songs — a bold move these days — is rare. Sumi has heard the questions about it plenty of times. ""People often ask, 'Why release an album now? Why ten songs? Nobody does that anymore.' But honestly, we've never approached music with that kind of overthinking,"" Sumi said.  The singer continued, ""Chirkutt is now 23 years old. When we started, we didn't think about strategy, or whether it would sell. We simply made music out of passion. Whether it was CDs or digital platforms never mattered to us. An album, for us, is a collection of our thoughts, our language. Our music is raw and honest. We've never tried to create 'hits'. We've always rejected typical market concepts — and perhaps that's why Chirkutt's songs have connected with people around the world in such a personal way."" Chirkutt's musical story began with their debut album ""Chirkutnama"" in 2010, followed by ""Jadur Shohor"" in 2013. Their third album, ""Udhao"", was released in 2017.","Mon May 12, 2025 03:39 PM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 03:47 PM"

The event boasts almost 30 acrylic works on board paper, offering viewers a glimpse into the artist's latest explorations. Eminent artist Monirul Islam attended the inauguration ceremony as the chief guest. Mustafa Zaman, director of the Department of Fine Arts, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy, also joined the occasion as the special guest. The artist Kazi Salahuddin Ahmed has lived through the 1971 war. Today, he is forced to witness entirely man-made destruction in regions such as Syria, Russia, Kashmir, and Myanmar. These tragedies, driven by the pursuit of power and control, have profoundly shaped his worldview. Over the decades, these experiences have left a lasting impression on his artistic journey, influencing both the themes and emotional depth of his work. Art critic Mustafa Zaman shared his impressions of the exhibition, stating, ""'Of Real and Emotional Debris: The complete eraser of Gaza which was once full of life, the continued miseries of people in Kashmir, or the hopelessness faced by the displaced Rohingyas trying eke out a life in camps in Chattogram, all this jostle the mind as one tries hard to think of the future of the human race."" ""It is also hard to leave behind the legacy of Bangladesh's multiple failures in sculpting a future. Here, the people's dream for political stability has always remained a chimaera. The fall of the repressive regime has certainly made way for all to focus on a future beyond the given structure, but it seems that things keep falling apart, and we are only left with emotional debris. I navigate through a landscape where the edifices of our collective dream lie in ruin, hence the title 'Debris',"" he added. The highly accomplished artist Kazi Salahuddin Ahmed held his first exhibition in 1987. He participated in many group exhibitions and carried out around 30 solo exhibitions in Bangladesh and abroad, particularly in France, the United States,  India,  Pakistan,  the United Kingdom,  China,  Japan,  Australia,  Nepal,  Iran and Yugoslavia.  The open-to-all exhibition will run until May 31 (Saturday),  from Monday to Saturday, between 3pm to 9pm.","Sun May 18, 2025 12:59 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 01:09 PM"
"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/theatre-arts/news/bengals-artists-reimagine-the-spirit-buddha-through-art-3896131","Bengal’s artists reimagine the spirit of Buddha through art","The eternal message of Buddhist peace has blossomed in a new light at La Galerie of Alliance Française de Dhaka. The exhibition, titled ""The Awakening to Sacred Peace: The Buddha of Bengal"", showcases the wealth of ancient Bengali painting traditions through the works of prominent and emerging Bangladeshi artists. This third edition of the Buddhist-themed exhibition, organised by the Oriental Painting Study Group and Learning Design Studio, reinterprets the aesthetic sensitivity of Buddhist tradition and the spirit of Buddha in Bengal. More than a hundred curated artworks by 73 artists reflect the emotional and spiritual resonance of the Bengali Buddhist heritage. The exhibition features multidimensional interpretations of Buddha's presence and philosophy through diverse media including oil paintings, watercolours, tempera, prints, ceramics, and sculpture—blending ancient imagery with contemporary expression. A special feature includes paintings inspired by Abanindranath Tagore's traditional wash technique, which many artists have echoed in acrylic and oil works that capture its clarity, softness, and aura. Another fascinating medium is the use of alcohol-based ink on synthetic paper, which expatriate artist Mostaque Ahmed has explored. It offers a compelling alternative to the traditional watercolour wash technique. Their works seem to touch the heart with the gentle waves of the ancient Bodhisattva, where the clarity of watercolour and the meditativeness of line become one. In other words, the young artists of this country have absorbed the Oriental tradition and added new dimensions to it. Sometimes dreamy, and sometimes in solid lines, they have created the merciful presence of Buddha. New songs of the young following the ancient path—the young artists, each as if carrying new leaves under the Bodhi tree, have painted the wonderful consciousness of Buddha in their language. The imitation of the Buddha's body-based sculptures by Arin Saha, Anushree Dey, Samia Sabiha Rini, and Avijit Kanti Das is created in an extraordinary style, a testament to the vitality of folk art. The delicate craftsmanship of embroidery is echoed in the various motifs of Bengali nakshi kantha art. The colourful exuberance of Monir Hossain's rickshaw painting, the lively drama of Hanif Pappu's cinema banner painting are depicted in the beauty of Buddha's compassion and humanity. For many, the lively colours and fluency of the folk artists have spread a kind of simple spirituality. Through the exuberance of colours, the vitality of lines and the pure expression, the teachings of Buddha seem to have merged with the soul of rural Bengal.  The rhythm of pottery and sculpture, especially the terracotta sculpture of Mukty Bhowmick, brings out a melodious sound of the song of the earth.  Manabendra Ghosh's ""Tired Buddha"", made of clay, is a metaphorical narrative of time and contemplation. These works of art, created in a rare blend of ancient pottery styles and modern language, remind us that life is fleeting, yet there is eternal liberation in every touch. The sculptures made with intense emotion in clay silently express the depth of Bodhi. Here, outline and emotion come together to create an image of inner worship.  The exhibition's strength, its diverse media, enhanced the experience of Buddha's serene detachment. Arpa Das Piu captures this through a gentle depiction of Buddha formed with Bengali calligraphy of his teachings. The woodblock workshop based on the life of Gautam Buddha has given a new dimension to the exhibition ""The Reflection of Buddha and Diamond Sutra"". The meditative form of Buddha has emerged in the works of the participating artists in this traditional woodblock workshop under the supervision of artist Rashid Amin and artist Saidul Haque Juise.  Various oriental techniques and styles are flowing in the works of other artists of this country. Oriental artist Amit Nandi, inspired by the relief process during the workshop he helped organise, created aesthetic prints resembling oriental paintings. His works like ""Buddha's Love for Life While Adoring a Deer"", ""The Farewell to His Beloved Horse"", and ""The Determined Solo Boat Journey"" reflect deep sensitivity and patience. The soft texture and shadowy atmosphere of printmaking seem to invite the viewer to an introspection. On the other hand, another skilled artist of printmaking, Muslim Mia, has crystallised another form of illusion in the medium of wash by applying two-dimensional colours.  It can be said that the luminous footsteps of young artists, that is, the combined breath of the young and the old, have created a spiritual series of paintings.  Art, culture, wisdom and love - all together have formed a beacon of light, from which an eternal message of peace, amity and compassion spreads. This is like another renaissance of Buddha in the heart of Bengal. In the hands of emerging artists, Buddha's philosophy has become a refuge of trust amid contemporary crises, an inexhaustible message of humanity.  The eight-day exhibition included diverse events such as a session on ""Gautam Buddha Geetikavya"" by Manoranjan Bala, blending narration, recitation, and music. Highlights include an art talk on ""Diamond Sutra Buddha's Image and Oriental Prints,"" a ""Charyagaan er Ashor"" by Bhavnagar Sadhu Sangha, and a cultural evening featuring Suborno Das Tanmoy on flute, Bappi Paul on tabla, and dance by Aritree Nandi and Prapti Ghosh.  ""The Awakening to Sacred Peace: The Buddha of Bengal"", concluding today, is not just an art exhibition—it is a silent hymn to the merciful presence of Buddha in the consciousness of Bengal. The viewer can stand in front of each work of art and feel that the ultimate truth of liberation, amity, and compassion lies within life. This exhibition is an aesthetic and awakening document of Bengal's Buddhist heritage. It reminds us that Buddha, the symbol of peace, returns again and again not only in the language of the past, but also in the language of contemporary art — with the light of hope, tolerance and introspection. In the eternal thirst for peace, in the eternal line of compassion, the Buddha, the light, is once again awakened in the heart of Bengal.","Fri May 16, 2025 07:10 PM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 07:21 PM"

Following the arrest, Cultural affairs adviser Mostofa Sarwar Farooki addressed the issue in a Facebook post.  In his post, Farooki expressed concern over the arrest and questioned the authorities' handling of the situation. 
 ""I generally try not to speak beyond the responsibilities of my ministry. But I do have an identity—I was a part of this industry and will be returning to it. The arrest of Nusraat Faria has become an awkward incident for us,"" said Farooki. ""It is the responsibility of our government to bring actual offenders from the July case to justice. When it comes to blanket cases, our stance is clear: no one will be arrested without a preliminary investigation indicating involvement. And that policy was being followed,"" he added. Farooki noted that although a case had existed against Faria for some time, there had been no apparent move by the government to arrest her prior to the conclusion of the investigation. ""But the incident occurred right after she arrived at the airport,"" he remarked.  He also drew connections between the timing of the arrest and recent political tensions, particularly public reaction to former Awami League president Abdul Hamid's travel abroad. ""Perhaps this incident resulted from over-nervousness or frustration. A few days ago, a similar incident happened with the wife of Barrister Andaleeve Partha. Such incidents are in no way justifiable,"" he said. Farooki expressed hope that Faria would receive appropriate legal recourse. He concluded his statement by urging more sensitivity in handling sweeping legal cases. ""And we hope to be able to handle such blanket cases with greater sensitivity.

Organised by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in partnership with the Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies (BILS), the exhibition aims to shed light on the vital yet often overlooked world of childcare services in Bangladesh, especially in the context of a growing female workforce. As more women join the country's labor force, the demand for accessible and reliable childcare is rapidly increasing. The exhibition explores the diversity of childcare models currently in practice, ranging from formal centers to informal community-based setups, and presents powerful visuals of childcare workers and the families they support. Through Hasan's lens, the exhibition captures the everyday realities of childcare providers: their dedication, challenges, and the working conditions that often lack standardisation in terms of hours, pay, safety, and access to social protections. The images also highlight the role childcare plays in enabling working parents, particularly mothers, to pursue employment while ensuring their children receive adequate care. Organisers hope the exhibition will initiate conversations about the professionalisation of childcare work and emphasise the need for fair labor conditions in this essential sector. The exhibition is free and open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to attend and engage with the narratives of those who are helping to shape a more inclusive and equitable workforce in Bangladesh.","Sun May 18, 2025 09:08 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 09:18 PM"

Pascal, known for his outspoken nature, responded to a question on political filmmaking by highlighting the urgency of storytelling in the face of fear-driven politics.  Referencing the climate under Trump's presidency, he said, ""Fear is the way they win. So, keep telling the stories. Keep expressing yourself and keep fighting to be who you are. Defy the people who try to make you scared… And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so in telling stories. And don't let them win."" Although he admitted feeling daunted by the gravity of the subject, saying, ""It's far too intimidating a question for me to really address, I'm not informed enough,"" Pascal's comments rang with personal truth. He then reflected on his family's past, one marked by political exile and survival. ""I want people to be safe and to be protected, and I want very much to live on the right [side of] history,"" he said.  ""I'm an immigrant. My parents are refugees from Chile. We fled a dictatorship, and I was privileged enough to grow up in the US after asylum in Denmark. If it weren't for that, I don't know what would have happened to us. I stand by those protections. I'm too afraid of your question. I hardly remember what it was."" Pascal's remarks come at a time when immigration is once again a heated political flashpoint in the US. This week, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new measure that would pay undocumented migrants $1,000 and offer them travel assistance to voluntarily return to their countries. The initiative is part of a broader crackdown reinstated by Trump during his second term, which includes stricter border enforcement and a slate of executive orders focused on detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants. With ""Eddington"" itself reportedly tackling themes of isolation and absurdity during the pandemic era, Pascal's remarks blurred the line between the political and the personal, reminding audiences that storytelling is often the first act of resistance.","Sun May 18, 2025 05:31 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 05:44 PM"

Formerly known as the hub of Bangladesh, Dhaka resides in an eerie, desolate moment in history – the Covid-19 pandemic. An unlikely pairing of a middle-class woman and her house help, in spite of all social barriers, make an unlikely bonding that defies convention and become each other's crutch for survival in the soul-cleansing flick that is Piplu R Khan's ""Jaya aar Sharmin"". As Jaya Ahsan and Mohsina Akhter, the two leads of the film, take sips of black coffee and rong cha respectively at The Daily Star's studio, the excitement levels vary among the illustrious mega-star and respected theatre practitioner. ""We learned nothing from the pandemic,"" Jaya Ahsan sighed at one point in the interview. ""We should have taken that as a warning that it is unwise to go against nature, to learn empathy and tolerance, but many, including myself, have forgotten."" The National Award-winning actress further emphasised that going back to the pandemic days, in an earthly story about two wandering souls, would rekindle the comradery and the sense of community that was built then. ""However, it is indeed heartening to see the reaction that the film got, I was taken aback by the kind messages that people sent, and the reviews on social media,"" said Jaya. For Mohsina Akhter, it is a breakout role in films, especially after travelling all over the world as a renowned theatre artist. ""It was a scintillating experience, especially because the freedom that I was given by Piplu bhai – at first, I genuinely thought that he would not let me improvise as I do on the stage, but I was taken aback when he told me to 'go for it'. Evidently, Mohsina's performance as the layered Sharmin evokes a range of emotions for the viewer. These emotions in front of the camera had an unintended spill over effect.  The director had staged the set in a way that the cameras were not as visible, and the suspension of disbelief was at its peak. ""Regardless of if the cameras were rolling, we were simply Jaya and Sharmin – the characters – going about their day. We were not in character, we simply were. This is why the audience will find it easy to connect with us,"" said Jaya Ahsan. The artistes reminisce fondly of a time when they had to maintain an unscrupulous amount of distancing, when they were forced to shoot the film with severe limitations, which includes the lack of a supporting technical crew, including a makeup artist. ""I do feel that it was charming, eye-opening even, that we went through that,"" echoed the actresses. ""Jaya aar Sharmin"" comes at a time that cultural personalities, and progressives in general, are under attack by right-wingers. In response to my curious query of how it affects them and how the artistes have decided to fight the 'cultural' war, Mohsina's answer is simple: ""We have to resist. Through our art, through social discourse, through simply being more humane, we have to resist, and promote tolerance, there are no two ways about it."" On the other hand, Jaya Ahsan has been fighting another fight for years – that of promoting awareness on violence against animals. ""I believe that I get much more credit for that than I should,"" she states ever-so-humbly. ""There are actual heroes out there who have dedicated their lives to those who cannot speak."" As Eid-ul-Azha looms around the corner, the actress has but one request for her fellow countrymen: ""In the season of sacrifice, please make sure to be humane towards the animals that we will sacrifice. Let's not hurt them unnecessarily, and keep them comfortable before the sacrifice is made, that is the true spirit of this season."" As ""Jaya aar Sharmin"", jointly produced by C te Cinema and Applebox films, continues to receive praise for cinemagoers, the actresses believe that the movie, surpassing its box-office legacy, will leave a humane mark on the viewer unparalleled to any other experience that they've had.","Sat May 17, 2025 09:00 AM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 09:00 AM"

A fixture in over 500 films, Dildar became a household name for his natural comic timing and lovable persona, earning titles like ""Hasir Raja"" (King of Laughter) and ""Hasir Feriwala"" (Peddler of Laughter). Throughout his career, he shared the screen with Dhallywood greats such as Shabana, Jashim, and Salman Shah. While he earned most of his fame in supporting comic roles, Dildar also led as the hero in the hit film ""Abdullah"", directed by Tojammel Haque Bokul, co-starring Nuton. The film's commercial success prompted many fans to call him by the film's title. His contribution to Bangladeshi cinema was widely recognised — he won numerous accolades, including the National Film Award for ""Tumi Sudhu Amar"". Dildar made his cinematic debut in 1972 with ""Keno Emon Hoy"", directed by Amal Bose, at the young age of 20. From there, his rise was unstoppable. With an unmatched presence, Dildar carved a unique space in cinema where laughter was his inimitable prowess. His colleagues often remarked that he had no rival; his biggest competition was himself. In personal gatherings and on set, Dildar was as warm and funny as his screen persona. His sudden passing on July 13, 2003, at the age of just 58, left a void that Dhallywood still struggles to fill. Furthermore, directors would often finalise their cast around Dildar, knowing that his presence guaranteed an extra layer of entertainment. His workload rivalled that of leading men, a testament to his demand and appeal. Dildar's legacy includes iconic performances in ""Beder Meye Josna"", ""Swapner Prithibi"", ""Antore Antore"", ""Anondo Ashru"", ""Gunda Number One"", ""Priyojon"", ""Noshimon"", ""Konnadan"", and many more. Born on January 13, 1945, in Chandpur, Dildar is survived by his wife Rokeya Begum and two daughters, Masuma Akhter and Jinia Afroze. His legacy, built over 38 years of relentless dedication to cinema, lives on through the laughter he gifted to millions.","Fri May 16, 2025 04:50 PM         Last update on: Fri May 16, 2025 05:00 PM"

Renowned for his roles in social dramas, Farooque became a household name through films that resonated deeply with rural and urban audiences alike. Though he played romantic and liberation war heroes, it was the social narratives that elevated him to iconic status. Farooque's legacy was first cemented with ""Lathiyal"", a powerful film that spotlighted the musclemen hired by rural elites to assert dominance. In the film, he delivered a compelling performance alongside Anwar Hossain, portraying sibling rivalry in a battle of wills. ""Lathiyal"" earned Farooque his first National Film Award and positioned him as a force in serious cinema. Another milestone in his career was ""Sareng Bou"", directed by Abdullah Al Mamun, where Farooque portrayed Sareng Kadam. His chemistry with co-star Kabori was electric, and the film's unforgettable song, ""Ore Neel Doriya"", remains etched in public memory. Farooque was again paired with Kabori in ""Sujon Sokhi"", a classic love story that continues to hold cultural significance. Directed by Khan Ataur Rahman, the film turned Farooque into a national sweetheart, with audiences affectionately calling him ""Sujon."" Its hit song ""Sob Sokhire Par Korite"" is still cherished today. In ""Noyonmoni"", directed by Amjad Hossain, Farooque starred opposite Babita in a film that became a career milestone. Their pairing as Noyon and Moni earned massive acclaim, and the songs ""Chul Doirona Khopa Khuley"" and ""Nani Go Nani Boli Je Ami"" became hits. Another Amjad Hossain film, ""Golapi Ekhon Traine"", featured Farooque as Milon opposite Babita as Golapi. The rural backdrop and heartfelt storyline found success at home and abroad. Songs like ""Hayre Kopal Mondo"" and ""Achen Amar Muktar"" remain fan favourites. Farooque's screen pairing with Rosy Afsari in ""Tasher Ghor"" and several other social films also drew attention during his prime. Known for his gentleness and dignity, the ""Mia Bhai"" of Dhaka cinema acted opposite most leading heroines of his time, including Rosy, Babita, and Kabori. Beyond social dramas, Farooque made notable contributions to films about the Liberation War. ""Abar Tora Manush Ho"" and ""Alor Michil"" earned him widespread critical praise. His success extended to commercial ventures like ""Jhinuk Mala"", co-starring Nipa Monalisa. The film's romantic song ""Tumi Amar Moner Majhi"" was especially well received. Farooque began his cinematic journey with ""Jolchhobi"" in 1971 and continued to enrich Bangladeshi cinema for decades. His presence on screen embodied the essence of social consciousness, romantic integrity, and patriotic spirit. Today, his legacy lives on through the timeless films and unforgettable characters he portrayed.","Thu May 15, 2025 07:11 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 07:22 PM"

Exiled Gazans Arab and Tarzan Nasser will on Monday screen ""Once Upon a Time in Gaza"", a portrait of two friends set in 2007, the year Hamas started tightening its grip on the territory. On the eve of the festival, ""Schindler's List"" actor Ralph Fiennes and Hollywood star Richard Gere were among more than 380 figures to slam what they see as silence over ""genocide"" in Gaza. ""The English Patient"" actor Juliette Binoche, who heads the main competition jury, paid homage to Hassouna on opening night. Sepideh said she had believed until the very end that Hassouna ""would survive, that she would come, that the war would stop"". ""But reality caught up with us,"" she said. Reporters Without Borders estimates around 200 journalists have been killed in 18 months of Israeli strikes on Gaza.","Thu May 15, 2025 09:35 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 09:45 AM"

An audio cassette shop! ""Geetika Recording Centre"", one of the oldest surviving music stores in Dhaka, is located on the first floor of Nurul Haque Market, and stepping inside felt like stepping back in old times. Time may pass, but some echoes never leave. CDs and cassettes remind us of a time when music was not just something we streamed; it was something we collected, felt with our hearts and cherished.  Patuatuli — a place that once echoed with music, rhythm, and voices immortalised on tape — has seen most of its iconic shops fade away. Yet, Geetika Recording Centre stands as one of the last survivors of that golden era. The shop was started in the '70s by Santosh Kumar Roy, a soft-spoken man with a deep passion for music. Back then, he was a first-year university student who would often wander into cassette shops. One of his friends' brothers owned a shop there, and Roy would spend hours at the music store. Eventually, he started his own shop, and while many others closed down, his legacy still lives on. ""Back in those days, when you needed a shirt, you had to go to New Market, but if you wanted to record a song or buy one, you had to come to Patuatuli. Every musician of that time had walked through these lanes,"" Santosh Kumar Roy recalls. According to him, the 1990s were the peak! Crowds would flood the area, so crowded that they even had to turn people away. ""Those days are now memories. We barely get customers now,"" he sighs. Roy shows me a vinyl record by the legendary playback singer and actress Suraiya Jamaal Sheikh, known as Suraiya, who was a superstar in the late 1940s and early 1950s. ""I still have this masterpiece,"" he says, handing over a record titled 'Best of Suraiya.' His vinyl collection includes records that are even older. He also proudly displays a collection of records by Mohammed Rafi, one of the most influential singers of the subcontinent. Roy shares, ""Music is food for the brain. Even the busiest soul needs a few moments to breathe; that's when you need music to calm yourself and feel alive again. Today, music is so easily accessible, and it's great! But it has made this generation impatient. Back when gramophones were used, you could only play two songs at a time. So, you had to truly engage with the music and feel the emotions deeply."" From floor to ceiling, the shop is filled with cassette players, DVDs, CDs, and even old audio recorders. It might look like a small shop, but it's more like a museum of lost melodies. I ask, ""Do people still buy these things?"" Roy smiles, ""You'd be surprised. Many people around my age or older still prefer records and cassette players over YouTube. They say the sound feels raw, and the emotion more real."" I met Showkat, who has been working there for 26 years, carefully restoring an old wedding video from a CD. The customer sat beside him, guiding him through the scenes — it was his own wedding video at risk of being lost. That customer turns out to be Prembabu, a Bengali film actor known for playing 'fighter' roles in the 1980s. He was also searching for CDs of the movies Daagi and Usilaa, in which he once played roles; films that are now nearly impossible to find. Another visitor, Abdul Hannan Munna, an elderly music lover, came in with a handwritten list of songs. He still listens to songs on cassettes. ""There's something about the sound,"" he says. ""You just don't get that feeling from modern devices."" The shop gets a mix of visitors: collectors, researchers, students, and people looking to transfer old cassette recordings onto memory cards, or vice versa. Some come just to relive memories, while others come to save them. Prices for cassettes and CDs usually start from Tk 500 and can go up to Tk 1500 or more, according to Md Jabed, another long-time employee who has been working at the shop for about 24 years. Roy passionately talks about music from the 1960s to the 1990s. ""The '60s were the golden era, when legendary singers like Abdul Alim and Abbasuddin Ahmed shaped our music. There was a time when their songs were heard in every household. At weddings, the bride's side only cared about one thing: a good speaker to play the music!"" he explains. As I left Geetika Recording Centre, I paused at the stairs. Isn't that all we need sometimes — a rewind button, playing a song we've forgotten, visiting a place where time stands still, or trying to hold the past a little closer? I look back and hear the shop gently whispering, ""Some things are too beautiful to be forgotten, no?""","Wed May 14, 2025 03:03 PM         Last update on: Wed May 14, 2025 07:46 PM"

Directed by Amitabh Reza, the series features Mosharraf Karim opposite eight different female leads, including Runa. In a conversation with The Daily Star, Runa Khan expressed her excitement about returning to work under Amitabh Reza's direction. ""He directed the Grameenphone ad that was a major turning point in my career. Working with him is always comfortable and creatively fulfilling,"" she said. Cinematographer Khosru also returned behind the lens for this project. ""It was lovely collaborating with Khosru bhai again after a long time,"" Runa added. When asked about working with Mosharraf Karim, Runa was full of admiration. ""He's always exceptional. Everyone knows his caliber as an actor. Having him as a co-actor elevates any production. He's incredibly collaborative and supportive during shoots,"" she said, noting that Mosharraf Karim even called her recently to praise her performance during the dubbing of ""Bohemian Ghora"". ""Mosharraf bhai called and told me he had seen my scenes while dubbing and thought I did a fantastic job. That means a lot coming from someone like him,"" she said happily.

In ""Bohemian Ghora"", Runa plays a confident, independent woman – a role she says gave her the space to truly perform. Aside from the series, Runa has recently completed filming for three new feature films: ""Bak"" by Masud Pathik, ""Dafan"" by Kaushik Sankar Das, and ""Leelamanthan"" by Zahid Hossain. ""All three roles are very different. Audiences will get to see me in three unique avatars,"" she shared.

The film marks another addition to the growing lineup of locally produced detective stories—this time, with an unconventional twist. Directed by actor-filmmaker Sumon Anowar, ""Mirza"" introduces viewers to a sleuth who defies the typical image of youthful, agile crime-solvers. Instead, Karim's Mirza is older, a little laid back, not one for chasing down suspects or getting into fistfights—but razor-sharp in intellect. Bongo recently released the film's first look poster on Facebook, featuring Mosharraf Karim in glasses and a cap, fully in character as the eccentric detective. The caption reads: ""Aitachhe Mirza, criminal bhagi ja!"" (""Here comes Mirza—criminals, run!"") Sumon Anowar explained the film's concept in an interview with bdnews24.com, saying, ""We don't really have homegrown detective franchises like Sherlock Holmes or Feluda. With 'Mirza', we wanted to create a detective whose unique to our culture—someone older, unfit for action scenes, but extremely intelligent and observant."" The cast also includes Parsa Evana, Arfan Mredha Shiblu, Tamanna Haque Borna, Shoumi, and Dilruba Doyel, among others. On working with the cast, Anowar added, ""Mosharraf Karim was brilliant in the titular role. Everyone brought their A-game, and the shoot itself was a joyful experience."" Sharing his hopes for the film, the director said, ""Every filmmaker feels their latest work is their best. With 'Mirza', we've taken a bold step into the detective genre, and we're excited to see how audiences respond.""","Wed May 14, 2025 01:37 PM         Last update on: Wed May 14, 2025 01:43 PM"

In the conservative decades of the 1950s and '60s, she carved her own path—fearlessly, freely, and unapologetically.  Novera's name remains inseparably linked to the original design of the Central Shaheed Minar, a national symbol of resistance and sacrifice.

The award was presented by actor and longtime collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio. The audience paid a heartfelt tribute to De Niro with a standing ovation as he received the accolade. Members of the festival jury also rose in applause, recognising the actor's monumental contribution to global cinema. De Niro is a two-time Academy Award winner, having won Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of young Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974), and Best Actor for his role as Jake LaMotta in Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" (1980).  He also received Oscar nominations for his performances in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978), ""Awakenings"" (1990), ""Cape Fear"" (1991), ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012), and ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" (2023).

"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/the-royals-netflix-crown-couture-and-confusion-3893801","‘The Royals’ on Netflix: Crown, couture, and confusion","At a time when OTT platforms are overflowing with gritty thrillers and intense dramas, Netflix's ""The Royals"" offers a much-needed escape into a world of luxury, romance, and family dynamics. At its heart, the series is a maximalist rom-com built on the most classic of tropes — opposites attract, rich boy meets self-made girl, palace intrigue meets pitch decks — dressed in some of our favourite buzzwords: feminist, queer-friendly, and unapologetically fashionable. It is refreshing to see a South Asian series embrace froth and flamboyance without constantly apologising for it. Then again, being aware of one's aesthetic does not excuse narrative shortcuts. While ""The Royals"" delivers big on styling and spectacle, its storytelling often trips on its own heels. The plot opens with Sophia Kanmani Shekhar (Bhumi Pednekar), the high-achieving CEO of a hospitality startup, WorkPotato, as she wins an international entrepreneur award in Sri Lanka. There, she literally collides with Aviraaj Singh (Ishaan Khatter), a smouldering prince with a six-pack, a camera crew, and just enough ennui to signal he is emotionally unavailable. They exchange electric glances, an ideological argument about class and privilege, and go their separate ways. Until, of course, fate and plot convenience bring them together again — this time at his crumbling family palace in Rajasthan, which Sophia wants to convert into a luxury bed-and-breakfast. From this point on, ""The Royals"" spins into an elaborate juggling act: a palace-turned-startup project with high stakes, a will with a mysterious heir, unresolved romantic tensions, and multiple supporting characters with their own ambitions and baggage. The setup is undeniably fresh — a struggling royal family turning their ancestral palace into a luxury homestay offers fertile ground for commentary on class, culture, and capitalism.   There is no denying that ""The Royals"" is visually gorgeous. From Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla's costume triumphs to grand sets bathed in soft light, the show stands as a Pinterest board for the aesthetically inclined. It wears its fashion-forward identity with pride, but beneath the layers of couture, there is a hollow core. The writing feels more like an afterthought than a spine. The dialogues often aim for cleverness but fall flat, character motivations feel inconsistently plotted, and dramatic twists arrive with little buildup or payoff. The biggest tension within ""The Royals"" is not between Sophia and Aviraaj; rather, it is between the show's desire to be a serious story about legacy, power, feminism, and modern entrepreneurship, and its simultaneous obsession with glitter, melodrama, and fairy-tale endings. It wants to say something, but it is not sure if it wants to be a rom-com, a family saga, or a commentary on new-age Indian womanhood. So, it tries to be all, and in the process, ends up stretching itself too thin. To its credit, ""The Royals"" does make a commendable effort at diverse and progressive representation. It treats queerness with nuance, not as a punchline, plot twist, or token gesture. Characters like Diggy, the royal-turned-chef, and Princess Jinnie are written with empathy, if not depth. Maharani Padmaja, played with warmth by Sakshi Tanwar, gets a rare second-chance love story arc that neither shames nor sidelines her desires. In the typical on-screen landscape, where widows are still too often depicted as tragic martyrs, this feels like a quiet revolution, albeit too fleeting. Even the show's strongest asset, its all-women creative team, does not shield it from narrative pitfalls. Too often, empowerment is shown in slogans, not struggles. Sophia is clearly designed to be a self-made icon, but beyond a few boardroom scenes and a traumatic backstory involving deceased parents, we never really see what makes her a formidable founder. Likewise, Aviraaj's character has the potential to explore masculinity beyond machismo. His rejection of royal responsibility, complicated father-son dynamics, and respect for female agency are nice touches. Although they are executed in such a glossy, conflict-free manner that he often comes off more like a Instagram boyfriend than a person.  Bhumi Pednekar does her best to lend gravitas to a character that's written more as a concept than a person. She is confident, emotionally available, and occasionally gets to bite into scenes with complexity. Ishaan Khatter, meanwhile, has the charm and physique for a rom-com lead but not the maturity to ground the emotional stakes of a character torn between duty and desire. Nora Fatehi, surprisingly, emerges as one of the show's more layered performers, and her portrayal of a savvy, strategic princess from New York adds some unexpected edge to the otherwise sweet palette of the show. Zeenat Aman, cast as the irreverent, weed-smoking Maaji, is criminally underused. What should have been a standout role, as the bohemian grandmother schooling her family in modern love and politics, ends up being little more than comic relief. Finally, Sakshi Tanwar and Chunky Pandey hint at richer narratives, but those threads get lost in the show's effort to juggle too many stories, too quickly.  So, if you are craving a frothy, easy-on-the-eyes binge with Instagrammable backdrops, swoon-worthy romances, and a killer wardrobe, this show delivers. However, if you're expecting ""Made in Heaven""-esque takedowns of wealth and power, or ""Bridgerton""-fashioned radical commentary wrapped in corsets and flirtations, this won't scratch that itch. For all its ambition, ""The Royals"" feels too safe, too polished, and too obsessed with being liked to take real narrative risks. Ultimately, it turns out to be a polarising experience. It is either a feel-good, feminist fantasy that finally lets Indian rom-coms breathe on OTT or an indulgent mess, more interested in sparkle than storytelling. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between: it is a series that tries to break the mould while clinging tightly to the tropes it is trying to outgrow.","Tue May 13, 2025 06:44 PM         Last update on: Tue May 13, 2025 07:04 PM"

In one of the highest-profile #MeToo cases to come before judges in France, Depardieu repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said he would appeal the court's decision. But judge Thierry Donard said Depardieu's explanation of events had been unconvincing. The #MeToo protest movement over sexual violence has struggled to gain the same traction in France as in the United States, although there are signs that social attitudes towards sexual assault are changing. One of the two plaintiffs, Amelie K, a set decorator, told the court the actor had groped her all over her body as he trapped her between his legs and made explicit sexual comments. ""He touched everything, including my breasts,"" she recalled. ""I was terrified, he was laughing."" The presiding judge said two witnesses corroborated her account whilst Depardieu, who was not present for the ruling, had been contradictory in his own accounts. Amelie K's lawyer described the ruling as a ""beautiful decision"" that gave recognition to Depardieu's victims. Depardieu has faced a growing number of sexual assault allegations in recent years, which has put a spotlight on how women are treated in the movie industry. He has consistently denied wrongdoing. His trial has laid bare a generational divide in France over sexism, with some prominent older actresses defending him. Brigitte Bardot, 90, told broadcaster BFM TV on Monday that ""those who have talent and grope a girl get thrown into the gutter"". Denying sexual assault, Depardieu had argued before the court that he did not consider placing a hand on a person's buttocks sexual assault and that some women were too easily shocked.","Tue May 13, 2025 04:54 PM         Last update on: Tue May 13, 2025 04:59 PM"

"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/hollywood-stars-condemn-gaza-genocide-eve-cannes-film-festival-2025-3893496","Hollywood stars condemn Gaza 'genocide' on eve of Cannes Film Festival 2025","More than 350 figures from the cinema world, including Hollywood stars Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon, condemned ""genocide"" in Gaza in an open letter published Monday (May 12) on the eve of the Cannes Film Festival. ""We cannot remain silent while genocide is taking place in Gaza,"" read the letter initiated by several pro-Palestinian activist groups and published in the French newspaper Liberation and the US magazine Variety. The signatories, which include acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and former Cannes winner Ruben Ostlund, decried the death of Gazan photojournalist Fatima Hassouna.  Hassouna, 25, is the subject of a documentary which will premiere in Cannes on Thursday (May 15) by Iranian director Sepideh Farsi, titled ""Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk"". Hassouna was killed along with 10 relatives in an Israeli air strike on her family home in northern Gaza last month, the day after the documentary was announced as part of the ACID Cannes selection. Farsi welcomed the impact of her film but called on Cannes Festival organisers to denounce Israel's ongoing bombardment of the devastated Palestinian territory. ""There needs to be a real statement,"" she told AFP. ""Saying 'the festival isn't political' makes no sense."" This year's Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche was initially said by organisers to have signed the petition, but her spokeswoman told AFP she had not endorsed it and her name was not published by Liberation. Other signatories include Jonathan Glazer, the British director of Jewish origin who won an Oscar for his 2023 Auschwitz drama ""The Zone of Interest"", as well as US star Mark Ruffalo and Spanish actor Javier Bardem. War programming The Cannes Festival kicks off Tuesday on the French Riviera, with an opening ceremony headlined by Robert De Niro and three films showing the devastation of Russia's war on Ukraine. Two documentaries featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and a third film shot on the brutal frontlines of Europe's biggest war in 80 years are to be screened on a ""Ukraine Day"" of programming. It is ""a reminder of the commitment of artists, authors and journalists to tell the story of this conflict in the heart of Europe"", the festival said. Nothing similar has been planned for the war in Gaza, but the film on Hassouna is set to ""honour"" her memory, organisers have said previously. Gazan filmmakers Arab and Tarzan Nasser are also set to showcase their fiction feature set in 2007 in the Palestinian territory in one of the secondary sections of the festival. The opening film on Tuesday evening is ""Leave One Day"" by newcomer French director Amelie Bonnin, before Hollywood heavyweight De Niro receives an honorary Palme d'Or. The Gerard Depardieu-sized shadow on Cannes De Niro is one of the most outspoken critics of Donald Trump in the American cinema world, with the ""Taxi Driver"" star often struggling to find words harsh enough for the US president. Trump has made himself one of the main talking-points in Cannes after announcing on May 5 that he wanted 100-percent tariffs on movies ""produced in foreign lands"". The idea sent shockwaves through the film world, although few insiders or experts understand how such a policy could be implemented. Cannes director Thierry Fremaux talked up the festival's ""rich"" American film programme on Monday (May 12), with movies from Wes Anderson, Richard Linklater, Ari Aster and Kelly Reichardt in the main competition. ""American cinema remains great cinema. The United States remains a great country of cinema,"" he said. Off-screen news in France is also likely to overshadow the red-carpet action in Cannes today, with French film icon Gerard Depardieu facing a verdict in a sexual harassment case in Paris. Depardieu, who has acted in more than 200 films and television series, is the highest-profile figure caught up in France's response to the #MeToo movement against sexual violence. Tom Cruise in town While independent cinema forms the core of the Cannes festival, organisers also hand over part of the programme to major Hollywood studios to promote their blockbusters. Tom Cruise is set to return to the Riviera for the premiere of the latest instalment of his ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise on Thursday (May 15), three years after he lit up the festival while promoting ""Top Gun: Maverick"". The festival will also see a series of high-profile debut films from actors-turned-directors, including ""Eleanor the Great"" from Scarlett Johansson and ""The Chronology of Water"" by Kristen Stewart. Organisers on Monday (May 12) denied reports that they had banned provocative near-nude dresses from the red carpet. However, ""full nudity on the red carpet"" has been formally outlawed, ""in keeping with French law"".","Tue May 13, 2025 11:04 AM         Last update on: Tue May 13, 2025 11:10 AM"

Directed by Piplu R Khan, the film was shot during the pandemic. Reflecting on the experience, Jaya said, ""We shot the film during Covid to capture that time authentically. We ensured safety while filming. We won't get that time back—and frankly, we don't want it back—but those who watch the film will feel transported to that period."" She further added, ""Many came face-to-face with death during that time. Many left this world forever. We are the ones who survived. It was an unstable, unsettling period—but we lived through it."" When asked about the challenges of filming during such a time, Jaya shared, ""It wasn't easy. It was incredibly difficult. Yet, we made the decision to move forward with 'Jaya Aar Sharmin' and completed the shoot successfully."" The film was shot in Dhaka, where an office space was transformed to resemble a house. Speaking about the production process, she noted, ""We filmed in Dhaka city. An office was made to look like a home for the shoot."" Regarding the director, she said, ""The director handled everything with precision. The visuals were captured beautifully."" When asked about the genre of ""Jaya Aar Sharmin"", the actress replied, ""It's a sensitive film. I won't give away the story, but I will say it's about the relationship between two women. It's a story about people."" To audiences, Jaya urged, ""Everyone should watch this film. Audiences will surely enjoy it. It's a beautiful story and a powerful portrayal of a moment in time."" On her co-actors, Jaya remarked, ""Everyone gave their best. Despite the difficult period, they brought immense love to the work."" Meanwhile, it is being reported that Jaya Ahsan will next appear in ""Tandob"", directed by Raihan Rafi, where she will be seen portraying the role of a female journalist. Her recent web-series ""Jimmi"" has also garnered praise from audiences following its release.","Tue May 13, 2025 10:38 AM         Last update on: Tue May 13, 2025 11:47 AM"

Although ""Rivals"" missed out on a win in its category, the night wasn't without celebration for its lead.

As confirmed by PWInsider, the icon breathed his last on May 11, only weeks after marking his retirement with a final bout against Joey Janela—billed as his farewell match. While the cause of his death has yet to be revealed, reports confirm that Sabu had previously faced serious health concerns.  In 2013, he suffered a medical emergency during the Squared Circle Expo, where he was rushed to hospital after collapsing on the show floor. At the time, Sabu acknowledged the incident through a brief post on Twitter (now X), stating he was recovering and thanking fans for their support, without disclosing further details. Tributes have since poured in across the wrestling community. Fellow ECW star Francine wrote, ""My heart is broken. Rest in peace to my friend Sabu. I love you always.""  Long-time ring partner Rob Van Dam paid homage with a simple finger-pointing emoji, a nod to Sabu's signature ring gesture. Brian Heffron, popularly known as The Blue Meanie, shared, ""Rest In Peace Sabu… Thank you, I love you, I'll miss you… I'm totally devastated.""  WWE star Damian Priest added, ""Rest easy, legend,"" along with a broken heart emoji. Trained by his uncle Ed ""The Sheik"" Farhat, Sabu began his wrestling journey in 1985. He first gained fame in Japan through promotions such as Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and New Japan Pro Wrestling, before joining ECW in 1993. His return to the franchise later that year led to a five-year run that shaped the hardcore wrestling genre. A three-time World Heavyweight Champion, Sabu will be remembered as one of the most innovative and fearless performers to ever step into the ring.","Mon May 12, 2025 09:28 AM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 09:39 AM"

Sumaiya Shimu: ""I owe it all to my mother.""
For seasoned actress Sumaiya Shimu, her mother's influence extends beyond the spotlight. ""My mother played the biggest role in both my academic and showbiz life. While my father also supported me, it was my mother who completely stood by me,"" she said. Shimu recalled how her mother accompanied her to early shoots and supported her cultural pursuits from childhood. ""I couldn't have started acting without her. In fact, many of our mothers came to sets in those days. It's impossible to measure her contribution in words."" Having been honoured alongside her mother on Mother's Day this year, Shimu added, ""Whatever love and respect I receive today from people, it's because of her. I dedicate this day to my mother and all mothers."" Shajal: ""If it weren't for her, I wouldn't be here.""
Actor Shajal also credits his mother with giving him the chance to pursue his dreams. ""My father didn't want me to work in showbiz. It was my sister and my mother who convinced him,"" he shared. ""At first, my father put restrictions. I was only allowed to do a limited number of projects. But my mother made all the arrangements behind the scenes for me to at least start."" Even now, his mother stays up until he returns home. ""I've often missed family events due to work. She handles everything. When I was sick as a child, it was my mother who never left my side. She truly is above everybody."" Tama Mirza: ""My mother is my strength.""
Award-winning actress Tama Mirza describes her mother as her partner in success. ""Whenever I win something, my mother is happier than I am,"" she said. ""She's been with me from the beginning and always will be."" Calling her ""Ammu,"" Tama fondly recalled winter nights shooting ads in Gazipur after long film shoots. ""I told her to sleep, but she stayed up with me. That's what mothers do- they share your burdens without a question,"" she said. Tama also shared how her mother's unwavering belief in her, even during career slumps, gave her the strength to persevere. ""She would always say, 'You can do it.' That one sentence carried me through difficult times."" As Bangladesh joins the rest of the world in celebrating mothers today, the stories of Shimu, Shajal, and Tama serve as powerful reminders of the irreplaceable role mothers play- on and off screen.  ","Sun May 11, 2025 09:18 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 09:45 PM"
"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/revisiting-the-most-unforgettable-moms-bollywood-3892106","Revisiting the most unforgettable moms of Bollywood","Mothers on screen are often reduced to clichés — the sacrificial, saintly figure or the melodramatic martyr. Then again, Bollywood notably holds a growing archive of stories where mothers are full-bodied characters: flawed, funny, brave, and deeply human. These women love fiercely, fight quietly, and exist beyond the frame of just being someone's parent. From fighting governments to challenging their children, they show that real motherhood is messy, resilient, and worth watching not just for sentiment, but for substance.  So, here is a celebration of the wholesome, memorable, and emotionally rooted portrayals of mothers on screen; the ones who did not just raise their children, but raised the bar for what motherhood could look like in cinema: 'English Vinglish' Sridevi's comeback role as Shashi Godbole in ""English Vinglish"", since returning to a film after being notably absent for years, was not just a stellar performance but a homecoming. A quiet homemaker mocked by her husband and daughter for her lack of English skills, Shashi enrols in a language course during a trip to New York. What follows is a beautiful unravelling and reclaiming of self-worth. The brilliance of Shashi's character lies in her everyday dignity, how she navigates condescension, loneliness, and casual dismissal with poise. She does not rebel loudly; she just becomes herself over the course of her journey. It is not about learning English but about reminding her family, and herself, that she was never incomplete to begin with. ""English Vinglish"" is undoubtedly one of Bollywood's gentlest tributes to a mother rediscovering her voice, while making the world pause to listen. 'Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway'
 Based on real events, this film is a masterclass in maternal fury and unbreakable love. Rani Mukerji's Debika is not polished or palatable, and that is exactly why her performance hits so hard. When her children are taken away by Norwegian authorities over cultural differences, she takes on the entire legal system to get them back. There are scenes where she sobs with abandon, protests with primal desperation; a reminder that motherhood is not about decorum but raw instinct. While critics debated the film's melodrama, audiences embraced the truth at its core: no government, courtroom, or clipboard can quantify a mother's love. Debika is not a caricature of sacrifice; she is a woman who refuses to be told she is unfit to love her children. 'The Sky Is Pink'
 Based on the real-life story of Aisha Chaudhary, this film is an emotional rollercoaster, but it is Priyanka Chopra's portrayal of Aditi, the mother, that anchors it with gravity and grace. Aditi is not your typical grieving mother. She is fierce, funny, determined, and organised to the point that it becomes her obsession. She is the kind of woman who will fight with airlines, doctors, and destiny if that is what her daughter needs. What makes Aditi's character stand out is that she is never portrayed as invincible. She breaks, she rages, she even disappears for a bit, but she always comes back stronger. The film does not glorify but humanises her. And in doing so, it reminds us that sometimes, strength comes at a cost greater than we know. 'Nil Battey Sannata'
 Swara Bhasker's Chanda plays a domestic worker with big dreams, not for herself, but for her disinterested teenage daughter. When her daughter refuses to study, convinced that poverty has already decided her future, Chanda takes the radical step of joining her school to show the possibilities. This film is about the silent rebellion of mothers who refuse to pass down limitations as a legacy. Chanda's character is all about grit wrapped in affection. She nags, hustles, and occasionally embarrasses her daughter, but never stops pushing her to aim higher. What makes her memorable is not the scale of her struggles but the enormity of her belief. She is the mom who teaches by doing, loves by challenging, and parents by dreaming, for the two of them. 'Mimi'
 Kriti Sanon plays Mimi, a young woman who agrees to become a surrogate for an American couple, but ends up raising the child herself when they abandon her midway. What could have easily become a melodrama turns into an endearing tale of unexpected motherhood. Mimi is impulsive, funny, and immature, and that is what makes her growth arc so satisfying. She does not become a mother when she gives birth — she becomes one through every sleepless night, every instance of fierce protection, and every goofy bedtime moment. The film tenderly flips the idea that maternal love needs to be biological or planned. Sometimes it arrives unexpectedly and remains firmly. In a rare win for Hindi cinema, Mimi is not villainised for wanting to be both a mom and a performer. 'Secret Superstar'
 Meher Vij as Najma is a revelation in this film. A soft-spoken housewife trapped in an abusive marriage, she is the secret force behind her daughter Insiya's dreams of becoming a singer. Insiya may be the protagonist, but Najma is the quiet revolution. She sells her jewellery, hides secrets, and encourages rebellion, all while bearing her husband's wrath without breaking her daughter's spirit. It is one of the most nuanced portrayals of mothers as enablers of freedom in deeply patriarchal homes. Najma is not fearless, but her love makes her brave. She does not push her daughter toward survival; she pushes her to fly high. When she finally finds her voice, it echoes for every silenced mother who once dared to dream. 'Mom'
 In one of Sridevi's final roles, she plays Devki, a stepmother whose relationship with her stepdaughter is strained until tragedy strikes. What follows is less of a revenge thriller and more of a maternal rampage soaked in moral greys. Sridevi walks the tightrope between legal justice and emotional closure with chilling precision. Her performance is raw, wounded, and never sentimental. It is about a mother who becomes a vigilante because she knows no one else will show up. The film complicates the idea of motherhood, suggesting that while love may not always be unconditional, loyalty certainly is.","Sun May 11, 2025 05:08 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 05:20 PM"

The actress, who lost her mother on March 24, 2024, shared a touching letter on social media, originally written on the first anniversary of her mother's passing. In the letter titled ""Maa O Maa"", Puja writes to her mother as if in conversation, revealing the depth of her grief and longing over the past year. ""It's been 365 days since I last saw you. The pain hasn't eased,"" she begins, recalling the trauma of the day her mother passed away. Puja opens up about the emotional burden she carries daily, describing her heart as weighed down by an invisible stone. ""I keep thinking if I cry, maybe it'll get better- but it doesn't,"" she writes. ""People say I'm strong, but they don't know- it's because I'm my mother's daughter."" The actress recounts how her mother, once unable to be away from her even for a minute, now remains unreachable. ""They say you're watching me from up there. I just wish I could see you, even once,"" she shares. Puja's words resonate especially on Mother's Day, a time that intensifies her sense of loss. ""Only those who've lost their mothers can truly understand what it means to live without one,"" she writes. ""I'm doing okay, Maa… though you'd know I'm lying. I love you so much, and if there's such a thing as another life, I want to be your daughter again."" The letter concludes with a promise and a plea for reunion. ""I won't see your magical face again in this life. But I know we will meet. Be ready for me."" Puja Cherry, one of Dhallywood's most prominent young actresses, has often credited her mother as her guiding force. The post has been met with an outpouring of support from fans, many of whom shared their own stories of maternal love and loss.","Sun May 11, 2025 04:47 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 04:56 PM"

Though their biological children live abroad, both actresses have chosen to remain in Bangladesh, enveloped by the affection of the audiences and colleagues who fondly call them ""Ma."" Dilara Zaman, who has two daughters living abroad, once joined them overseas but eventually returned home. ""I couldn't stay away,"" she said. ""Everyone here calls me 'Ma.' This land, these people-I can't leave them. The children of this country are my children. That's the greatest reward of all."" Despite being far from her daughters, she is never alone. The entertainment industry embraces her with familial warmth, constantly checking on her, celebrating her legacy, and treating her as their own. In recognition of her decades-long portrayal of motherhood, Dilara Zaman was awarded the ""Ma Padak"" (Mother Award) in 2023. This year, the same honor goes to another screen icon, Dolly Zahur. Like Dilara, she also lives alone in Dhaka while her only son, Riasat, resides in Australia. Although she visits her son and he returns when possible, Dolly too has been unable to leave behind the emotional tether to her homeland. ""The love here keeps me rooted,"" she shared. ""When I had COVID, everyone rushed to help. Some even stayed in the hospital with me. That kind of love-you can't describe it, only feel it."" Both actresses, through their enduring portrayals of maternal characters, have transcended the screen to become real-life matriarchs of the industry. Their stories speak to a deeper bond- one that goes beyond bloodlines and blossoms in the hearts of those who have grown up watching them.  ","Sun May 11, 2025 01:01 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 01:07 PM"

Although not a party to the lawsuit, Swift's name emerged in Baldoni's $400 million defamation suit against Lively and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds. The case includes text messages in which Lively appears to refer to Swift as ""one of her dragons,"" with Baldoni's legal team identifying her as the unnamed ""megacelebrity friend"" referenced in the filing. In a statement to Variety, a spokesperson for Swift clarified that her only connection to ""It Ends With Us"" was licensing her song ""My Tears Ricochet"" for use in the trailer and a scene.  The spokesperson stated, ""Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see 'It Ends With Us' until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history."" The texts in question allegedly relate to a rooftop scene in ""It Ends With Us"", which Lively reportedly rewrote. According to the filing, Baldoni was summoned to Lively's New York penthouse, where Reynolds and the ""megacelebrity friend"" expressed support for Lively's revised scene.  Baldoni later texted Lively, ""Also was working on rooftop scene today, I really love what you did… (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor)… Really excited [and] grateful to do this together."" Lively, in another message, compared herself to ""Game of Thrones'"" Khaleesi and wrote, ""My dragons also protect those I fight for… we all benefit from those gorgeous monsters of mine. You will too, I can promise you."" Swift's representatives dismissed the subpoena as an attempt to generate media buzz. ""Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case,"" the spokesperson stated. Meanwhile, actress Isabela Ferrer, who stars in ""It Ends With Us"", claimed in an interview with Extra that Swift had ""played a helpful part"" in her casting, although the details of this involvement remain unclear. The dispute between Lively and Baldoni began in December, when Lively filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment and launching a smear campaign.  Following a New York Times report on the matter, Baldoni sued the newspaper for $250 million on grounds of libel, before countersuing Lively and Reynolds in January. Lively and Reynolds have filed motions to dismiss the defamation suit, claiming it is retaliatory and stems from their initial harassment allegations.","Sun May 11, 2025 10:28 AM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 10:36 AM"

He died at 7 am on Saturday morning at a hospital in Banani. His daughter, Sharmin Abbasi, confirmed the news. Abbasi had long been suffering from age-related ailments and was most recently hospitalised due to breathing complications. He breathed his last around 5.30 am.  Born on December 8, 1937, in Cooch Bihar, West Bengal, Abbasi came from a celebrated musical lineage. His father, Abbas Uddin Ahmed, was a trailblazing folk singer who brought Bengali folk music to international prominence. His uncle, Abdul Karim, was also a noted performer of Bhawaiya, Bhatiali, and other folk genres. His family included other distinguished figures: his brother, Justice Mustafa Kamal, was a prominent legal mind, while his niece Nashid Kamal and sister Ferdousi Rahman both earned acclaim as accomplished musicians. Abbasi spent his early years in Kolkata, where his family maintained a close connection with National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. He began his academic journey there and later earned both his B.A. (Honours) and M.A. degrees from the University of Dhaka in 1959 and 1960, respectively. He also pursued marketing studies under the Harvard Group.  Throughout his career, he established himself as a leading figure in both music and literature. He directed many music-centered programs on radio and television and was a well-known columnist across several publications. Professionally, he served as the General Manager of an industrial group and was later appointed Director General of the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. His contributions to cultural diplomacy included performing Bhatiali, Bhawaiya, Chatka, Bichhedi, and Nazrul Sangeet in 25 countries and representing Bangladesh at the International Folk Music Conference in Seoul, South Korea. For eleven years, Abbasi served as President of the Bangladesh National Committee of Music under UNESCO, participating in several international music forums. As director and collector of the Folk Music Research Group for over five decades, he preserved thousands of rare and traditional Bengali songs, including works by Lalon and various regional folk genres. His editorial contributions include significant anthologies such as Duar-e Aisachhe Palki and Songs of Independence Day, and he also served as the editor of the ""Journal of Folk Music"".  Among his most acclaimed publications are ""History of Folk Music"", ""The Birthplace of Bhawaiya"" (Volumes I & II), and ""Bhater Desher Bhatiali"". The first volume of ""Bhater Desher Bhatiali"" featured six hundred songs with notations and analysis and received praise both nationally and internationally.  Author of 21 popular books, Abbasi's lifelong dedication earned him numerous accolades, including the Shilpakala Academy Award, Lalon Award, Nazrul Academy Award, Abbasuddin Gold Medal, Apex Foundation Award, Ekushey Padak, National Press Club Literary Award, and more.  Even in his later years, he remained actively involved in global cultural dialogues, such as the Asia Media Summit, international Rumi and Sufi conferences, and folk heritage seminars, while continuing to contribute to radio and television programming. Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus today expressed deep shock at the death of renowned musician, researcher and writer Mustafa Zaman Abbasi. In a condolence message, he said the contribution of Mustafa Zaman Abbasi, an Ekushey Padak recipient, to the Bangladesh's music will be remembered forever. The chief adviser prayed for eternal peace of the departed soul of Abbasi and convoyed deep sympathy to the bereaved family.

Known for a voice that can pack a punch, she quickly made a name for herself in the folk genre—a testament to her unique signature style. Now, she is ready to take a new turn. The singer has stepped beyond her folk roots to explore a more diverse musical direction, beginning with her latest release ""Chol Preme Pure Jai"" — a chill step number whose lyrics, tune, and composition have been handled by Autumnal Moon. Released under the banner of G Series, the track marks a refreshing shift in Dora's journey as an artiste. We caught up with the singer after an exclusive photoshoot at The Daily Star Centre to talk about her evolution, her inspirations, and her forthcoming musical journey. ""People are familiar with my folk songs, and I usually perform those more than any other genre, whether on stage or at any show,"" shared the singer. ""However, after a three-year break, I wanted to come back with something outside my usual style. So, I shared my thoughts with Moon da, expressing my interest in experimenting with a different genre—and he took care of the rest! I'm truly overwhelmed by how warmly people have embraced the song."" It's not just the music that has captured attention—the accompanying music video, filmed across the breathtaking landscapes of Nepal, is a visual delight. Featuring Dora herself amid stunning natural backdrops, the video adds both depth and emotion to the song's narrative. ""We shot it last year in Nepal and it was a truly memorable experience—one I'll always cherish,"" she shared. ""This was the first time I not only appeared in a music video but also acted in it. Previously, I had only appeared in studio setups alongside the musicians to lend my voice. This time, it was a completely different experience,"" she mentioned. Although Nadia Dora comes from a culturally rich background, her journey into music was anything but conventional. Without formal training, she shaped her path, inspired by the voices she admired. ""Whenever I listened to singers like Fareeda Parvin, or later Anusheh Anadil, Faizan Rashid Ahmad Buno (Popularly known as Buno) from Bangla band, Nigar Sultana Sumi from Lalon band, and Sharmin Sultana Sumi from Chirkutt—my love for folk music grew stronger,"" she shared. This passion for music led her to become a part of the band Dharok. ""We didn't have original songs back then, but we used to cover Rabindra Sangeet and other classics,"" Dora recalled. In 2014, she, alongside some of her close friends, formed the band Pandora, only to focus on working on a new style of fusion and rock music. Their last release was in 2016, and Dora disclosed that they have reunited once again with original material in the works. The current lineup includes Zia on bass, Fahim, also a co-founder, on lead guitar and vocals, Debashish on drums, and Bipu on guitar.  ""We're working on two new songs, which we hope to release by the end of this year. Fahim and Debashish were abroad for a while, which delayed our work. But now we're back and also actively performing at stage shows."" Dora spoke candidly about the common practice of syndicating artistes in the music scene. ""The problem arises when an artiste starts working with a particular group—they often become part of a syndicate without even realising it. Such grouping is deeply concerning, as it hampers the entire industry. Individual artistes end up losing new potential creative collaborations because of such alliances.""  ""I won't shy away from admitting that I, too, was part of a syndicate for a long time. Now, I'm glad to have returned after a break, and moving forward, I hope to work in an environment that encourages open and creative collaborations rather than building barriers through a 'syndicated mindset.'"" Dora also shared her concerns about so-called ""mobs"" reportedly disrupting recent stage shows. ""We perform on stage regularly, and to be honest, due to growing security concerns in recent times, we often decline shows outside Dhaka,"" she admitted. ""However, so far, we haven't faced any problems and things have been going well, with excellent security at our events."" When she's not making music, Dora works in the sales and marketing department of a private television channel, balancing her dual careers with dedication.","Sat May 10, 2025 12:23 AM         Last update on: Sat May 10, 2025 12:25 AM"

During its inauguration on May 6 at the Bishwo Shahitto Kendro Art Gallery, veteran painter and Professor Emeritus Rafiqun Nabi graced the event as the chief guest. Artist and writer Professor Abul Mansur and art critic Syed Azizul Haque also attended the ceremony as speakers. Following the affectionate speeches from the guests, Prof Nabi declared the exhibition to be open for visitors.  When I laid my eyes upon the name ""O Death O Dance"", I knew it was something I needed to dive deeper into, and seeing the artworks, I was overwhelmed. As an architecture student myself, and a person who was trained in visual arts as an extracurricular activity, I feel and realise the dedication and patience a person needs to create a detailed ink work. The depth of skills in optical illusion and the sense of proportions, volume, and discipline are crystal clear in Mazumder's drawings. ""O Death O Dance"" features semi-abstract artworks done by Mazumder. His pen strokes depict his utmost control over the tools he has used — the lines are crisp, bold, and strong. The techniques and the intention behind the drawings have a sense of certainty in them. However, the directions, flows, shapes, and sizes are unpredictable, which makes the artworks much more intriguing. The forms are dynamic, and the volumes of spaces have hierarchy among them, giving the drawings a three-dimensional appearance. This sort of optical illusion has a high demand in today's art world. The artist has a great sense of colours. He evidently keeps the colour saturation to a level that's comfortable for everyone to gaze at. The vibrant strokes create chaos, and yet the overall drawings look deeply and soothingly sublime. Sometimes there are glimpses of buildings in one-point perspective, ornamented with floral patterns, and these look straight out of fairy tales. The artist left me wondering if the compositions with chess pieces have any connection to politics. All the artworks have a certain language, similarities in the expressions, and yet, each is different from the other. The artworks of Mobassir Alam Mazumder are unconventional and prove the extent of his ability to weave imagination into reality with delicate patterns and thought-provoking visuals. This one-of-a-kind art exhibition will continue to run at Bishwo Shahitto Kendro Art Gallery till May 10 (tomorrow).","Fri May 9, 2025 05:52 PM         Last update on: Fri May 9, 2025 06:02 PM"

According to a statement from his representative, the Brooklyn-born director died ""peacefully in his sleep earlier this week"" at his Los Angeles home following a prolonged battle with brain cancer. Born on December 28, 1953, Foley studied film at New York University before completing his degree at the University of Southern California. His entry into Hollywood came through a chance encounter with celebrated director Hal Ashby during his final year of film school—an incident that would prove pivotal in launching his career. Foley made his directorial debut with ""Reckless"" in 1984, starring Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah. His collaboration with Madonna began shortly after, directing iconic music videos such as ""Dress You Up"", ""Papa Don't Preach"", ""True Blue"", and ""The Look of Love"", along with the 1987 film ""Who's That Girl"", where Madonna starred opposite Griffin Dunne. He continued to make his mark with films like ""At Close Range"" (1986), featuring Sean Penn and Christopher Walken, and ""After Dark, My Sweet"" (1990). Foley also directed an episode of ""Twin Peaks"" before achieving critical acclaim for ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" (1992), a David Mamet-penned drama with a star-studded cast including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Alec Baldwin. Pacino earned an Oscar nomination for his role in the film. In 1995, Foley reunited with Pacino for ""Two Bits"", followed by the thriller ""Fear"" in 1996, starring Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon. Although modest at the box office, the film helped propel both actors to stardom. His other directorial credits include ""The Chamber"", ""The Corruptor"", ""Confidence"", and ""Perfect Stranger"". After a challenging experience with ""Perfect Stranger"" (2007), Foley stepped away from film for a period, turning to television. He directed episodes of ""Hannibal"", and later joined Netflix's ""House of Cards"", directing 12 episodes. He also directed two episodes of Showtime's ""Billions"". Foley returned to feature films with ""Fifty Shades Darker"" and ""Fifty Shades Freed"", taking over the franchise from Sam Taylor-Johnson. Throughout his career, Foley was known for his versatility across genres and platforms. In interviews, he often spoke of his instinct-driven approach to selecting projects and his preference for not being pigeonholed. He also highlighted his focus on character dynamics, particularly male relationships shaped by alienation, loyalty, and betrayal, which echoed throughout his filmography. James Foley is survived by his brother Kevin, sisters Eileen and Jo Ann, and nephew Quinn. He was preceded in death by his brother Gerard.","Fri May 9, 2025 12:35 PM         Last update on: Fri May 9, 2025 12:43 PM"

"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/10-years-piku-soothing-classic-still-hits-home-3889896","10 years of ‘Piku’: A soothing classic that still hits home","Ten years ago, a film about bowel movements, a road trip, and a Bengali father's hypochondria quietly slipped into theatres. Then, like that one relative who would not stop talking about their digestion at family dinners, it stayed in our collective memory far longer than expected. Perhaps more than a film, ""Piku"" became a prolonged sigh shared across generations, smelling faintly of home and unresolved emotional constipation. There was nothing dramatic about it. No plot twists, no grand reveals, no life-changing resolutions. Instead, it meandered like a Friday morning—slow, persistent, filled with minor arguments about digestion and dietary fibre, and heavy with a stillness that said more than words ever could. Yet, a decade later, it feels more relevant than ever. Perhaps because, as we grow older, we find ourselves turning into exactly the kind of people we swore we would never become — people like Bhashkor Banerjee.  Played with comical precision and tragic depth by Amitabh Bachchan, Bhashkor was the embodiment of that maddening, overbearing love that suffocates and sustains you in equal measure. He had opinions on everything: marriage, bowel movements, property rights, and feminism. Watching him is like watching your own parents through a magnifying glass—their flaws enlarged to the point of absurdity, but underneath all that, they're so disarmingly familiar it almost hurts. And then there was Piku, played with heartbreaking restraint by Deepika Padukone, who gave voice to everyone who has had to pause their life to manage someone else's. Her tired eyes, bluntness, and quiet fury at being needed all the time were not dramatic, they were simply real. It is the kind of reality that gets buried under deadlines, doctors' appointments, and lunch breaks. Piku was not a heroine, she is one of us. Especially now, when many of us are caught between Zoom meetings and aging parents who still would not take their medicines unless reminded five times. What ""Piku"" understood, and what most films still do not, is that caregiving is not an act of sacrifice so much as it is a daily negotiation with guilt. It is loving someone while being internally angry at them for making you forget who you were supposed to become, and that is exactly what made this film hit home harder than others. It does not wrap that anger in a pretty bow or offer catharsis in the form of some dramatic reunion, it allows the anger to simmer. It holds space for annoyance, for selfishness, and for grief to exist without climax. Of course, there is Rana played by Irrfan Khan. If there is a more perfect example of a reluctant empath in Indian cinema, I have not seen it. He was not a saviour. He was exasperated himself and perpetually one bowel complaint away from quitting. However, he chose to stay because he understood it all — the madness, the mess, the emotional residue of middle-income families where love is rarely said but always felt. Rana did not fix anything; he just showed up, and sometimes, that is enough.  Looking back now, ""Piku"" feels like a time capsule of everything we did not know we would grow into: The way life refuses to offer closure. The way arguments become heirlooms. The way you start to sound like your father without realising it. It is not just about ageing, but the slow erosion of boundaries between you and the people who raised you. One day, you are rolling your eyes at their eccentricities. Next, you are Googling the fibre content in the rockmelon they forced you to eat while yelling at your partner for keeping the AC at 24 degrees Celsius. Even the film's pacing mirrors life as it unfolds in middle age—tedious, interrupted, and filled with bathroom breaks. It did not rush to make a point. It just sat there, like an old relative who has overstayed their welcome but also brought along stories you did not know you needed to hear. Watching it again now, ""Piku"" almost feels prophetic. In an era obsessed with escape, the film reminds us that we never really leave home. We carry it with us in our habits, frustrations, and microbiomes. For me, what elevates ""Piku"" is its refusal to glorify ageing, parenthood, or even love. It presents everything as is—chaotic, inconvenient, and annoyingly persistent. Just like Bhashkor's constipation, it becomes a metaphor for everything we do not talk about: repressed emotions, stubborn attachments, and our desperate attempts to stay in control even as our bodies and lives slowly betray us. The satire was always there, gently tucked into realism. The idea that a man could hijack an entire household with his digestive woes was both hilarious and terrifying. We have all met him — and maybe some of us are on our way to becoming Piku, too. Perhaps this is the beauty of ""Piku"": That in its quiet corners and everyday absurdities, it saw us before we saw ourselves. So, even after ten years, the film does not feel old. It feels like that inevitable truth we have been resisting that finally caught up. That growing up is not about letting go but holding on, even when it is uncomfortable. Especially when it is uncomfortable. That love, in its most undramatic form, looks a lot like routine. And that sometimes, the most honest expression of care is asking someone if they have had a proper bowel movement.","Thu May 8, 2025 06:40 PM         Last update on: Thu May 8, 2025 06:47 PM"
"Entertainment","https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/music/news/legacy-tagore-songs-bengali-and-hindi-films-3889831","A legacy of Tagore songs in Bengali and Hindi films","Today, on 25th Boishakh, the 164th birth anniversary of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, the legacy of his music continues to echo far and wide- not just in the hearts of Bengalis, but across the cinematic landscapes of both Bengal and Bollywood. While his poetry and songs remain an inseparable part of everyday life, Rabindra Sangeet has also found a cherished place in both Bengali and Hindi cinema, often adapted, referenced, or directly used to elevate cinematic storytelling. The first known use of a Rabindra Sangeet in film dates back to Tagore's own lifetime. In Pramathesh Barua's 1937 film ""Mukti"", with music directed by Pankaj Kumar Mullick, Tagore's music entered cinema for the first time.  Since then, more than 200 of his songs have been used in Bengali films, with notable examples being Ritwik Ghatak's ""Meghe Dhaka Tara"" featuring ""Je Rate Mor Duarguli,"" and Satyajit Ray's ""Kanchanjangha"" and ""Jana Aranya"", which beautifully integrate ""E Porobashe Rabo Ke"" and ""Chhaya Ghanaichhe Bone Bone"" respectively. Tapan Sinha's Atithi featured ""Amar Mukti Aloy Aloy,"" while Ajoy Kar's ""Malyadaan"" included ""Ghorete Bhramar Elo Gun Gunie."" The incorporation of Rabindra Sangeet has often lent a profound emotional weight to cinematic storytelling. In films like ""Streer Patra"", the use of ""Banglar Maati Banglar Jol"", and in ""Ghare Baire"", where ""Bidhir Bandhan Katbe Tumi"" is featured, the melodies enhance the narrative's emotional core. Similarly, in ""Teen Kanya"", the inclusion of ""Baje Karun Sure"" remains a poignant moment. Director Tarun Majumdar is particularly noted for seamlessly weaving Tagore's compositions into his works, with films such as ""Shriman Prithviraj"", ""Bhalobasa Bhalobasa"", and ""Alo"" receiving praise for their melodic sensibility. The film ""Nimantran"", featuring the timeless ""Dure Kothao Dure Dure"", continues to be remembered for its evocative musicality. Bollywood, too, has borrowed from Tagore's musical genius. In the 1950 film ""Afsar"", Sachin Dev Burman composed ""Naina Diwane"" drawing from ""Sedin Dujone."" In ""Sujata"", ""Jalte Hain Jiske Liye"" was inspired by ""Ekoda Tumi Priye."" Hrishikesh Mukherjee's ""Abhimaan"" features the legendary ""Tere Mere Milan Ki Yeh Raina"", directly inspired by Tagore's ""Jodi Tare Nai Chini Go"". Several Hindi films have also drawn from the works of Rabindranath Tagore, adapting his melodies to suit diverse cinematic contexts. In ""Didar"", the song ""Bachpan Ke Din"" is based on Tagore's ""Mone Robe Kina Robe Amare"", while ""Taxi Driver"" features ""Jaaye To Jaaye Kahan"", inspired by ""He Kshoniker Otithi"". The film ""Waaris"" offers another notable example, with the song ""Rahi Matwali"" drawing from the composition ""O Re Grihobashi Khol Dwar Khol""—reflecting how Tagore's influence transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries. Bappi Lahiri's ""Nanha Sa Panchhi Re Tu"" from ""Toote Khilone"" drew from ""Bhenge Mor Ghorer Chabi,"" while Yarana's ""Chhu Kar Mere Mann Ko"" echoed ""Tomar Holo Shuru Amar Holo Shara."" Jugpurush's ""Bandhan Khula Panchhi Uda"" took cues from ""Pagla Hawa'r Badol Dine."" Shantanu Moitra's ""Piyu Bole"" in Parineeta was crafted in the spirit of ""Phule Phule Dhole Dhole"". In Bangladesh, several films based on Tagore's stories and songs have been produced, including ""Shasti"", ""Subha"", ""Kabuliwala"", and ""Abujh Bou"". Among these, Chashi Nazrul Islam's ""Subha"" stands out for its poignant use of ""Chander Hasi Badh Bhangese"". As the world commemorates Tagore's birth anniversary, his music continues to transcend time and borders, breathing soul into cinema and reminding us of the enduring power of art that speaks to the deepest human emotions.","Thu May 8, 2025 04:06 PM         Last update on: Thu May 8, 2025 04:46 PM"

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/it-doesnt-rain-shukhno-gram-3897386","It doesn’t rain in Shukhno Gram ","In a forgotten railway station where the rain never falls, a solitary station master's routine is upended by an unexpected visitor in blue. It's a quiet tale of chance, connection, and longing as the romantic story unfolds. When studying economics back in DU, I never imagined that I would end up working at an old, rundown railway station in a desolate, remote village. But here I was: a station master in charge of possibly the least active railway stop in the country. It is called Shukhno Gram Rail Station, named after the village, although the locals call it Hoogna Geram. Why shukno, hoogna, or dry? Because it does not rain around here! Now in my mid-30s, I have been posted at this station for almost a decade — and not a raindrop in my career. My job has its perks, of course. No corporate politics, no Excel sheets; just minor interactions, basic record-keeping, etc. But no exciting stories either. I have become as dry as this village. On a warm May afternoon, a train stopped at my station. I frowned. The first and last train of the day had left several hours ago. A train would stop now only if someone pulled the emergency handle. A minute later — a grunt, followed by a heavy luggage being tossed out, followed by a woman in a blue saree. ""Excuse me! How can I go to Dhaka from here?"" the lady in blue asked, rubbing off beads of sweat below her nose while the train disappeared. I was dumbfounded. There was no easy answer to her question. She had to take muddy roads, trawlers, and local buses to get to the nearest city. After I explained all that, she yearned, ""When is the next train?"" ""Tomorrow noon,"" I replied helplessly. Then, after dragging the luggage to the waiting room, she fell on one of the benches, shut her eyes, and began to rest. I now closely studied this strange woman. The rojonigondha on the wrist contrasted with her dusky skin. The aalta on her palms and fingers gave a festive vibe. Large but not too flamboyant jewellery glistened in the sunlight that poured into the waiting room through large windows. The meticulously draped blue saree hid most of her sweat-drenched black blouse. ""Never seen a beautiful woman before?"" she sleepily taunted, with her eyes still closed! She woke up with a shudder. After recovering and remembering her whereabouts, she let out a sigh. ""Why are you here?"" I eventually addressed the elephant in the room. It was now dark outside. The station was even more desolate at night. The temperature was much cooler, at least by our Hoogna Geram standards, which is a relief, given that electricity is almost always out. Taking a sip from the cup of tea that I offered, she replied flatly, ""I ran."" ""Eloped?"" ""Ran away from my wedding that is taking place in two days,"" she continued. ""I came as far as I could and got down at this random station. This is so childish. I will go back tomorrow."" I looked at her helplessly. ""And why are you here?"" now she asked me back. ""What do you mean, why I'm here? I am the station master."" She slowly got up from the bench and took a seat beside me. ""No, really, why are you here? You seem to be a nice, talented man wasting and rotting his life away in this place."" I had not been confronted with this question in a long time! Graduating from economics, while my friends frantically applied for corporate jobs or started their own businesses, I walked around the campus aimlessly. You see, I always wanted to be an artist. But instead of Charukala, I chose economics, doing what I thought would be the right thing to do. My desire to paint never went away. And so, after I was done with studies, I couldn't help but paint and travel, leaving economics forever. That was how I discovered this place. I settled here because there was no one to bug me, and I was in love with the beauty of the village — the blazing krishnachura blooms, the muddy pathways, crystal-clear skies, and quiet and stillness. ""I want to see your art,"" she told me after hearing all this. I showed her some sketches — a large banyan tree just outside the station, trains arriving and departing, my guard dog Bhulu and his pals who made this station their home, a colleague and friend who worked in another shift, the baul who often visits me for a chat, but most of all, harrowing scenes of droughts of the Shukhno Gram.   She was moved, touched, and shocked to know that it never rains here. Then, she playfully declared, ""If it rains before my train comes, I will not return to Dhaka and stay here!"" ""Ok Google, will it rain today?"" — I asked my phone, to which Google remained silent. Network issues! She chuckled, leaning against a wall. ""You won't get so lucky!"" Warm rays of the morning sun shot at her face, so much so that she couldn't keep her eyes open properly. But she held her pose — leaned on the wall sideways — as I busily dipped my paintbrush on the palette and focused on the canvas in front of me. I painted furiously: locks of hair, large earrings, blue saree, olive-toned skin, white petals, red aalta. ""You didn't tell me last night why you eloped,"" I continued. ""Does it matter? Aren't you glad that I did?"" I let it go. She told me many things yesterday — her job in a management consultancy and how much she hated it, her friends and family who by now must be really worried about her, and how much she loved this saree that belonged to her mum and decided to wear it at the pre-wedding party that she eventually escaped from. But she didn't tell me why she escaped. By the time I laid down my paintbrush, it was almost time for the train to arrive.  She stared at the canvas in awe. ""Do you really find me so beautiful? You keep it. Put it in a gallery one day and invite me to your exhibition when you become a famous artist!"" I brought her luggage to the platform. ""No rain,"" I sighed. ""No rain, sorry!"" she reiterated and laughed. ""Go home and sleep. I wanna be alone for a while. Your shift has ended a long time ago anyway."" ""So, is the wedding back on?"" She turned pensive, paused, and announced again, ""It didn't rain."" Shukhno Gram Rail Station became smaller and smaller as I looked on while sitting at the back of a rickshaw-van. When the building got rather tiny, I heard a rumble — a thunder! Rahim Miah braked. ""Station master, what is happening?"" A cold breeze. Grey clouds. A lightning. Another thunder! ""Take me back to the station! Hurry!"" The villagers were out on the meadows and fields. Children ran out of their school. Farmers looked at the sky in disbelief. Energy and anticipation swept through. But it doesn't rain in Shukhno Gram, remember? It may show some false hope once or twice a year, only to break people's hearts again and again. The grey clouds soon subsided, and the skies were clear. This village is cursed. By the time I rushed back to the station, it was like any other day -- hot, humid, dry. The short-lived hope of a downpour was gone, and so was the train. I turned back wearily to go home.  Suddenly, someone called out, ""Excuse me! I think I missed a train."" I know this voice. I turned around again. There she was — all smiles — my bride in blue!   Model: Shababa Rashid

For the elderly, however, this is rarely sufficient. Their bodies could have difficulties adjusting to heat, and in more grave cases, present serious health hazards. If you are worried about protecting your elderly loved ones from the scorching heat that is sweeping over the country, take the necessary steps towards better health now. Keeping a towel in the fridge might work wonders. When placed over the shoulders or legs, it cools the skin gently and safely without leaving the person feeling jarringly chilled by ice or freezing packs. In fact, cooling is not just about AC or fans. Wet cloths can be applied to the different pulse points around the body including the neck, wrists, or behind the knees to help with reducing core body temperature. While full showers sound like heaven in summer, sponge baths with lukewarm water and a soft cloth works best for the elderly. It soaks their body gently, and is especially important for those having heart or blood-pressure issues since abrupt changes in temperature can be harmful. Another simple yet effective thing would be to keep soothing products in the fridge. This could be anything from lotions, to misting sprays, to even small pillowcases. Its cold application can provide relief from skin irritation produced by heat. In particular cases, elderly people can use mist sprays over their arms, legs, or face when they feel that they are suffering from itchy skin in the heat. Through evaporation, this is a good cooling option and pairs well with a fan. At times, medications are also known to influence elderly people with increased sensitivity to heat. This is because some medicines may interfere with water retention or heat regulation, raising the temperature sensitivity of an individual. If you are concerned regarding this, have a doctor or pharmacist go through all prescriptions and see what adjustments could be made to the medication on days of extreme heat. During heatwaves, one should not underestimate the need for breathable feet. Coax your elders into wearing sandals or perhaps a soft slipper around the house to keep their feet from overheating. That being said, avoid rubber or plastic on hot floors, as they actually trap heat and add to general discomfort. Last but not the least, focus on food for elders' hydration. Heavy, warm meals tend to increase the core temperature of the body. So, water-rich fruits such as watermelon and cucumber are the way to go, along with light alternatives such as smoothies.","Thu May 15, 2025 04:18 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 04:22 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/who-needs-gold-costume-jewellery-the-real-treasure-3897391","Why costume jewellery is dominating Bangladeshi fashion","It mirrors our heritage and cultural identity, and pairing it thoughtfully with an ensemble reflects our personal flair for styling. Women who effortlessly think outside the box — who know how to play with fabrics, colours, and accessories — are flamboyant fashionistas without question. Costume jewellery only add to that appeal. Made of sterling silver, alloys, nickel silver or German silver, copper, zinc and nickel —jewellery are all in fashion now high. Costume jewellery add a touch of extravagance to the muted bling look. Pairing ethnic or antique traditional ornaments with the right attire adds not only charm but also a chic edge, elevating any look to stand out. Such styling is now a favourite practice of fashion-conscious young adults and chic mature women.  Today, women are also appreciating the in-trend contemporary, delicate, fuss-free ornaments. Classy women, with a panache for style, are embracing both the old and new. Modern and contemporary styling is all about pairing old-style with cutting-edge fashion and ethnic or traditional jewellery amps up your style quotient. The design of traditional jewellery has evolved over time, especially in detailing like adding intricate designs in multiple layers or using large gemstones. Jewellery is classified into three distinct categories: trinkets or costume jewellery, semi-fine, and fine jewellery. Costume jewellery capitalises on a specific, fleeting trend with the use of non-precious stones, Swarovski crystals, rhinestones, and affordable metals and alloys. Semi-fine jewellery is gold-plated, or gold-filled like sterling silver, and uses affordable stones like topaz, opal, garnet, etc. They have a shelf life and will also stand the test of time like fine jewellery. The glitz, glam, and all things precious like solid gold, pure silver, platinum, with precious gems make the world of fine jewellery. The intricate designs of jewellery from different countries spin a historical narrative of the place it originated from. The complexity of designs and workmanship of Bangladeshi, Indian, Afghan, Pakistani, Pashtun, Iranian, Ottoman, and Rajput jewellery are starkly different from one another. They vary in terms of design arrangement, the use of gemstones (both precious and semi-precious), the inlay work or minakari, the addition of chipped stones, and in other techniques. Ornaments in Nepal, for instance, are characterised by the extensive use of turquoise, while Rajput ornaments speak of opulence and splendour. Afghan jewellery, especially Kuchi jewellery, has colourful glass insets and metal. The famous chokers with glass inlays and dangles are a must-have item in your Afghan jewellery collection. Strings of semi-precious stones, pendants, amulets of lapis lazuli, emerald, tourmaline, kunzite, and agate must be part of your jewellery collection. These pieces of jewellery, from the ethnic groups of Nepal, Rajasthan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, which drew inspiration from ornaments worn by nomadic women of these places, are all a collector's item and come with a price tag. What makes costume jewellery special is the ability to tell a story. Whether it's through vintage finds, handcrafted tribal pieces, or bold contemporary designs inspired by cultural motifs — the ornaments are not just accessories but wearable art forms that celebrate individuality and artistic expression. Whether layered over a handloom saree or paired with a minimalist outfit, they effortlessly transition from casual daywear to statement evening looks, proving that elegance does not always have to come with a hefty price tag. Jewellery of any kind is a good investment, traditional or modern, tribal or semi-precious, is not the point in question. Rather appreciating the heritage, art, and craftsmanship, and the modernity in jewellery designs speaks volumes about your elegance and good taste.   Model: Shababa Rashid, Farzana Hoque

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/where-are-the-summer-lovers-now-3895306","Where are the summer lovers now?","Every winter, a certain species re-emerges — let's call them the Summer Sentimentalists. They show up like New Year's resolutions: full of grand declarations but barely making it past February. You've seen them. Heard them. Probably muted them on social media. Wrapped in oversized hoodies while sipping overpriced hot chocolate, they post things like, ""I miss the warmth of summer,"" or ""I just want to feel the sun again."" Well, guess what? Summer is here. And Dhaka — this summer isn't just hot — it's being cooked. Not metaphorically, not poetically — literally. With temperatures steadily hitting 38-40°C and humidity smacking you in the face, stepping out at 3 PM now feels like entering a malfunctioning sauna that charges you extra even for breathing. Office-goers look like they've run marathons, and schoolchildren resemble survivors of some science experiment involving lava. The air no longer moves — it hovers. And the sun? It doesn't shine. It taunts, harasses, and assaults. Less ""Hello, sunshine"" and more ""Kneel before me, mortals"" kind of attitude these days. The dust sticks. The sweat stings. The overhead fans are basically decorative at this point. And the biggest betrayal of all? Power cuts. In 2025. During heatwaves. Let that sink in — though nothing sinks anymore except morale. And this is practically the new normal. Some days feel like 46°C in Dhaka, unless a moody cloud gets emotional and decides to cry over Mohammadpur. Basically, the city has transformed into a full-fledged urban heat island — thanks to our unholy alliance with carbon emissions and concrete jungles. Even the crows — nature's most shameless noisemakers — have fallen ominously silent in this heat. You know it's hot when the crows go quiet. Interestingly enough, another species has gone quiet — the one I was talking about in the first place. Yes, the Summer Sentimentalists. Remember them? The sun-craving poets of January? They've vanished faster than a Wi-Fi signal during load-shedding. No more sun-drenched Instagram stories with Coldplay in the background. No more tweets romanticising the smell of sunscreen and mangoes. These once-vocal admirers of vitamin D have gone radio silent — probably lying face-down in air-conditioned rooms, regretting every word they ever said about ""missing summer."" To track the current activity of this curious species, we conducted a quick lifestyle census (we cornered some sweaty pedestrians). It revealed the new migration map of the former summer enthusiasts! We found that a large group of them are now air-conditioned mall hoppers, suspiciously lingering in shopping centres — not buying, just breathing. Another group has turned into amphibians, living in buckets or under showers. They now prefer water to emotions. Still, there are some flat-out denialists. ""It's not that bad,"" claims Ismot, who prefers not to go out because he might faint in this heat. Now the question is, dear denialists, if you truly love summer, why are you hiding behind your double-glazed windows and quietly deleting those ""I love summer"" Instagram posts from 2019? Go out. Bathe in the sun. Show your love for the season — if you dare! Meanwhile, the brave few — the delivery riders, street vendors, and rickshaw pullers — are carrying the city on their sunburnt shoulders. Let's be honest, they are the true summer warriors. So, if you're still claiming you're a summer person, it's time to prove it. Go out, touch some sunlight, and take a walk from Farmgate to Shahbagh at 1 PM. Then come back and tell us how romantic the heat felt on your third-degree tan. Because this isn't Tuscany. This is Tejgaon in May. And no, we don't want to see you reposting some reel with ""Summer breeze makes me feel fine…"" while sitting next to a table fan the size of a UFO. Sure, we still have mangoes, sugarcane juice, and the occasional unexpected evening rain that feels like nature's apology letter. But let's be real — the season has changed. Summer in Dhaka is no longer a mood. It's apocalyptic! So, to all the summer lovers out there: Either come out and own it, or stop posting mango-filtered lies. We see your thermostat! It's set to ""Antarctica,"" and we're not fooled!","Thu May 15, 2025 04:13 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 04:18 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/lifehacks/news/surviving-bangladeshs-heatwave-ac-free-solutions-3895301","Surviving Bangladesh's heatwave: AC-Free solutions","As a heatwave sweeps across the country, many of us feel exhausted and restless all day. To combat the fatigue, it is not enough to stay indoors only — we also need to make sure the environment inside is cool and refreshing. While air conditioning is our go-to solution, we often tend to forget about the high-power usage, affordability issues, and technical difficulties. To tackle the harsh sun this year, here are a few alternative cooling techniques you can follow to stay energised throughout the day, without depending on an AC. More often than not, a cluttered room can obstruct natural air flow, causing the room to trap heat. To regulate the indoor temperature, keeping your room clean and minimal can play a crucial role. Get rid of bulky furniture, heavy textiles and fabrics so that air can travel inside your room smoothly. Remove items with heat-retaining materials like wool or velvet. Make sure to keep your flooring free of thick rugs — it will naturally feel cooler underfoot. Think of rearranging your furniture in a way that ensures lots of open space, as it ensures breezes to distribute cool air evenly throughout the room. One of the most cost-effective ways to block the heat in your room is to place a wet sheet, preferably cotton-made light-coloured fabric by the window. As warm air from outside flows through the moist fabric, it draws heat out of the air, cooling it before it enters your room. This age-old technique works like a natural air-conditioner! Make sure to rewet the sheet every couple of hours to continue the cooling effect. Placing a bowl of ice, frozen water bottles, or an ice pack in front of your portable fan can drastically cool down the room. In case you are using a ceiling fan only, keep a bucket full of ice or cold water in the room to achieve the same results. During the peak heat hours, this process can offer instant relief from the sweltering heat. This method is somewhat energy-efficient, and a quick and practical way to create a cool zone in any room. Did you know lighting has a strong impact on indoor temperatures? Traditional incandescent and halogen bulbs emit a significant amount of heat — making the surroundings feel uncomfortable. To avoid that, opt for energy-efficient LED bulbs, which not only consume less electricity, but also emit very little heat in comparison. If you are open to investing a little for a more effective cooling solution, a dehumidifier can be a smart choice. These devices work by eliminating excess moisture from the air, which in turn, helps maintain a cool environment. As a heatwave makes humidity levels reach higher, your skin feels sticky even if you are indoors. Keeping humidity under control can make sure you have a fresh atmosphere in the room, leaving you feeling comfortable. To make your home a little cosier and cooler in summer, make sure of proper cross ventilation in the room, so that fresh air can pass through the room without difficulty. If your room is situated on the west side where the heat gets harsher, opt for dark and double-layered curtains to reduce heat gain into your room. If your home is right underneath the rooftop, you can wet the rooftop floor to keep your ceiling cool during the peak hours. Use plenty of greens by the windows and balconies to improve the air quality of your home.","Thu May 15, 2025 04:09 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 04:13 PM"

Once known as the ""Flag Girl"" for proudly waving our red-and-green flag across borders, she is now catching attention with her refreshingly bold, cultural attires in Sydney, Australia. Priota Iftekhar first rose to fame by fearlessly travelling solo with the Bangladeshi flag in her hands. It was a powerful act that broke stereotypes and sparked a movement rooted in identity, freedom, and national pride. She is also the founder of an online community, The Flag Girl. ""When I travel abroad, people often don't realise I'm Bangladeshi,"" says Iftekhar with a smile. ""Many have never even heard of Bangladesh and assume I'm from India. And that's exactly why I decided to come up with things that somehow represent who I am and where I come from."" Priota Ifetkhar started The Flag Girl project in 2009 and it allows people to stay connected around the world. People from more than 50 countries are members of this network, mostly young people. Her global influence was later acknowledged in 2018 when she won the title of Miss Culture Worldwide. And now, she is continuing her path as the director of Bangladesh Tourism Beauty, an organisation that is empowering women and showcasing Bangladeshi culture to the world. Now based in Australia, Iftekhar's expression of cultural identity has taken on a new form, particularly through fashion. Her most recent photoshoot, full of bold colours, familiar symbols, and street-style nostalgia is a magnificent homage to Bangladesh. In one unforgettable look, Iftekhar wears a tailored blazer made from gamcha — a humble, chequered cotton fabric used across Bangladesh. The piece of textile was actually sourced from Dhaka's New Market and transformed into a high-fashion statement. The accessories told just as much of a story: earrings shaped like tiny jhalmuri cones (the streetside, spicy, Bangladeshi puffed rice snack), fuchka-inspired earrings, and even a handbag styled to look like a double-decker BRTC bus. All these quirky, joyful pieces were crafted by the creative minds at ""Sketch & Handmade Craft — Art Gallery"". The shoot also featured international model Valeria Busch, who wore a striking dress designed by Media Ahmed Dipa, with the bold message ""Banglar mayera meyera shokolei muktijodhdha"" meaning, Bengali mothers and daughters are all freedom fighters. She also carried a matching box bag designed by Sharollo, with the same fierce sentiment. Outfits designed by Shagufta Shahid Etrat under Mezro Agency were showcased in the photoshoot, which was not just about fashion but a celebration of identity, memory, and pride. As a certified personal stylist and model, Iftekhar has found her own way to make a statement. Whether she's walking the runway or styling a look, she carries her roots with pride. ""In everything I wear and do, I try to showcase my culture,"" she explains. Currently, she is preparing for the upcoming Australian Fashion Week and her goal is clear. She's planning to wear a saree that captures the essence of Bangladesh, something unmistakably hers and undeniably homegrown. ""People here genuinely appreciate our culture,"" she says. ""And I never want to miss a single opportunity to represent it with pride."" This purpose is not just a word in Priota Iftekhar's life; it's a part of her upbringing. Growing up, she was surrounded by stories of boldness and vision. Her grandmother, Nurjahan Begum, did not just write history, she made it as the trailblazing editor of Begum magazine, a powerful voice for women at a time when few dared to speak up. Her grandfather, a journalist at The Daily Ittefaq, believed deeply in nurturing young minds through the ""Kochi Kachar Mela"". With his camera, he captured the soul of a nation during the Liberation War and carried those images to the world — telling Bangladesh's story when it mattered the most. That legacy of courage and creativity shaped Iftekhar as a person. She became the first in her family to earn not just one, but two master's degrees — one from the prestigious University of Technology Sydney. However, degrees were only the beginning. She now brings her passion to life as the PR and Communications Manager at JICS Australia, where she leads multicultural initiatives that celebrate diversity, inclusion, and identity. What sets Priota apart is not just her résumé — it's her presence. Whether she's speaking on a panel, walking the runway, or simply strolling through Sydney, there's something magnetic about her. She carries her heritage not as a burden, but as a badge of honour. Imagine walking down a street in Sydney and seeing a girl carrying a handbag that resembles a packet of crackers — the same one you used to munch on during school breaks. And then you notice her earrings: tiny plates of fuchka, so perfectly detailed that it seems like they came straight from a street stall in Dhaka. For a moment, you might feel that you're not in Sydney anymore. You're back home! And just when you think it can't get more nostalgic, you realise she's wearing a bold blazer, which is made from the same cotton that's used to make a traditional Bangladeshi gamcha. Sounds surreal? Perhaps, but it's real and Priota Iftekhar is making it happen.   Photo: Courtesy

As temperatures rise, fashion leans into comfort without wanting to let go of elegance. This summer, style is less about making a loud statement and more about thoughtful choices with lighter fabrics, cleaner cuts, and a softer, more personal way of standing out. Whether it is the easy flow of kameez and saree, or the relaxed charm of a panjabi, summer 2025 is about pieces that breathe, move, and quietly command attention. The classic kameez remains a summer staple, but it's the structure and fabric that adds style to it. Think shorter hemlines paired with flared pants, sleeveless or loose full-sleeve designs, and breezy cottons that hold shape but feel weightless. While neutral tones set a safe base, careful pops of embroidery, block prints, and abstract geometric patterns add to the structured look -- a perfect combination for office and outings. Nothing says Bengali perfection like a saree. However, summer demands a certain looseness in how we approach it. Lightweight weaves like muslin, cotton silk, and khadi are the go-to choices. Sarees in solid colours like ivory, lemon yellow, and pale peach look striking and serene when styled with contrasting blouses or even a crisp crop shirt for a modern spin. Handloom textures and patchwork remain at the heart of the trend with subtle borders or embroidered motifs. This season is not about heavy embellishments; it's about breathing life into tradition with lighter, airier versions that can move from daywear to dinner with just a change of accessories. For men, the summer panjabi steps firmly into the spotlight. Gone are the overly formal versions reserved for festivals. Instead, light cottons, linens, and mixed fabrics in soft tones set the tone for everyday wear. Very minimal chikankari work or subtle thread detailing is enough to make a panjabi stand out without feeling weighed down. Paired with slim-fit pyjama trousers, shalwars, or even denims, the look is polished but easy-going. Summer dressing this year is not about how much you can add, but how much you can refine. Accessories are kept to a minimum; a pair of statement silver earrings or a delicate chain around the neck. Sandals or ballet flats complete the look without competing for attention. This summer, with the heat challenging every step of the way, you must give yourself permission to breathe. Choose pieces that make you feel like yourself, even when the sun weighs heavy. Whether you opt for kameez, kurti, saree, shirt or panjabi, make sure your statement speaks softly but clearly. Less noise, more nuance. And always, a quiet kind of cool.   Model: Parinaz

Embracing the theme of Black dandyism in full, the men who walked the icon stairs of the Met Gala were seen in sharp suits, headpieces, body jewellery, and other accessories. Here are six of the lot that really understood the assignment. The Met Gala is an awaited event every year, with mere mortals on the other side of the screen keeping a close watch on what their favourite celebs wear. This year, however, was especially important for SRKians around the world, and why not? It was King Khan's first time on the Met carpet after all, and fans were beside themselves in anticipation. Khan did not disappoint either, as he stepped out in an all-black ensemble designed by the famous Indian designer, Sabyasachi. He paired a crepe de chine silk shirt with a hand-canvassed, single-breasted long Tasmanian superfine wool coat. The coat, peak collared and wide lapelled, was accented with monogrammed Japanese horn buttons, and the superstar wore a pleated satin kamarbandh to complete the look. He accessorised his outfit with layers of custom-made jewellery and stole the show further with the Bengal Tiger Head Cane ""crafted in 18k gold with tourmalines, sapphires, old mine cut and brilliant cut diamonds."" Dazzling the red carpet was 55-year-old actor Colman Domingo, who was also playing ambassador to the event alongside names such as F1 driver Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, Pharrell Williams and Anna Wintour, and honorary chair LeBron James. He was first seen in a dramatic, bright blue, floor-grazing pleated cape and an embellished collar (royal vibes unlocked) and then, in a black and white windowpane plaid Valentino. He added a polka-dotted necktie and a polka-dotted flower to his outfit, layering on the drama, one accessory at a time. Even though the event's dress code was ""Tailored for You,"" a nod to the exhibition's focus on menswear and suiting, Punjabi actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh chose to veer in a different direction, with regal Indian attire. His look was truly one for the books, complete in an ivory outfit embroidered with Gurmukhi alphabets and the map of Punjab, a bejewelled turban with a feather, a lion-headed kirpan (sword) and a neck piece reminiscent of the famous Patiala Necklace that had been crafted by Cartier, almost a hundred years ago. He sported on his hand, a Cartier watch, to complement his statement jewellery. Inspired by Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, a former ruler of the state of Patiala, Dosanjh's outfit was a nod to men's fashion in the Indian Subcontinent back in the day, and a successful attempt to bring Punjab right into the contemporary fashion scene of the Met. Dosanjh's outfit was designed by Prabal Gurung, and the jewels were customised by Jaipur-based jewellers, Golecha Jewels. Not to be outdone by Colman Domingo in any way, the other co-chair of the Met Gala, F1 champion Lewis Hamilton owned the event in an off-white ensemble and snow diamonds, custom-designed by acclaimed British designer Grace Wales Bonner. Hamilton chose a cropped silk tailcoat and high-waisted trousers with tux stripes for his base outfit. Despite its deceptively minimalistic outlook, his outfit had a lot going on, albeit in the same or similar shades. He embellished it lightly, with a sash encrusted with cowrie shells that symbolised wealth and spiritual protection in African culture and mother-of-pearl buttons. He wore a matching beret, garnet-studded earcuffs, and baobab tree (tree of life) brooches to seal the look. Pushing the boundaries of fashion, celebrated Indian designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee turned muse for himself at the Met Gala this year. In charge of dressing celebrities and the crème de la crème of Indian and international society, the maximalist designer stole the show in a hand-quilted court jacket and sherwani in hand-dyed Murshidabad silk. He styled it with black quilted trousers, a satin shirt, a kamarbandh, and embroidered formal shoes, befitting his exuberant style. Ditching the tie, a symbol of colonialism, Sabyasachi turned to a selection of necklaces from his own coffers, the Bengal Royale High Jewellery collection. In the designer's own words, ""In the Sabyasachi world, the tie has been replaced with Indian jewellery; formal for sure, and richer indeed."" Very dandyish, very playful, Andrew Scott's look from the 2025 Met Gala featured a three-piece suit in Smurf blue and other contrasting colours such as mustard yellow, red and black. It was different from his look in 2024, where the All of Us Strangers star was seen in an all-black Versace ensemble. His 2025 outfit was designed by the Italian house, Giuliva Heritage. Taking inspiration from legendary Harlem designer Dapper Dan, famously known as the ""king of knock-offs"" the designers chose to keep the outfit plain, without too many over-the-top accessories, or headgear, save a simple corsage on his lapel, relying instead, mostly on their choice of colour and texture. A genius move perhaps, to make the outfit a truly quirky, memorable one was the actor's choice of footwear — black and white pointees with block heels. While many are on the fence about his accessory of choice, plenty of others have lauded his sportiness and spirit in wearing it, associating it with real, unapologetic dandyism. Formally known as the Costume Institute Benefit, the Met Gala is an annual haute couture fundraising event that supports the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan. Many people consider the Met Gala to be the most prestigious and elegant fashion event in the world.","Wed May 7, 2025 03:54 PM         Last update on: Wed May 7, 2025 03:59 PM"

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/travel/news/biman-suspend-dhaka-narita-flight-amid-losses-3897446","Biman to suspend Dhaka-Narita flight amid losses","  Amid much fanfare, Biman Bangladesh Airlines resumed flights to Japan's Narita in September 2023. Within 21 months of restarting the much-anticipated service, Biman yesterday announced the suspension of operations on this route, effective from July 1. The national flag carrier said the decision was based on three factors: the ongoing hajj operations, shortage of aircraft in its fleet, and financial viability of the route. However, insiders said the airline was compelled to take the decision as it has been incurring heavy losses since resuming the service. Officials told The Daily Star that Biman has so far incurred losses of over Tk 84 crore on the route, averaging around Tk 4 crore per month. Biman had first launched flights on the Dhaka-Narita route in 1979. After a temporary suspension in 1981, the service was resumed, but it was again suspended in 2006 due to continuous losses. Seventeen years later, on September 1, 2023, the route was reopened without a proper assessment of its commercial viability. Since then, the relevant departments at Biman have reviewed passenger numbers, revenue, and operational costs. Several officials, seeking anonymity, said the key figures behind the resumption of the Narita flight were then managing director Shafiul Azim and then acting director (sales and marketing) Salauddin Ahmed. At the time, tensions were ongoing between the then Sheikh Hasina government and the United States. Biman's fleet primarily relies on Boeing aircraft, manufactured in the US. During that period, European aircraft manufacturer Airbus offered to sell planes to Biman. Salman F Rahman, who is now behind bars and was then the PM's adviser, reportedly supported the Airbus proposal. In this context, Biman launched flights to destinations such as Narita, Rome, and Toronto, without assessing commercial viability, in what officials said was an attempt to justify the purchase of new aircraft. The move was promoted as an achievement of the then Sheikh Hasina government. Biman operates the Narita route with Boeing 787-800 aircraft, which have 271 seats. Insiders said nearly half the seats remained vacant on most flights. Data from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport shows that Biman is the only carrier offering direct flights between Dhaka and Narita. Eight other airlines operate connecting flights on the route via third countries. Asked about the suspension, Biman spokesperson ABM Raoshan Kabir said the airline had been incurring losses on the route. ""Biman suspended operating this flight due to poor cabin factor,"" said Raoshan, who is also general manager (public relations) of Biman. In aviation, cabin factor or load factor is a key metric that reflects how efficiently an airline fills available seats on its flights. Contacted last night, Shafiul Azim, who was made secretary to the Election Commission while serving as Biman MD and CEO in May 2024 and is now an OSD, said the allegation of not assessing financial viability was baseless. ""We had further plans centring the Narita flight. We had plans to go to Los Angeles and Vancouver through code-sharing agreements with All Nippon and Canadian airlines,"" he said. In aviation, code-sharing is an arrangement where one airline sells seats on a flight operated by another carrier under its own flight number and code, allowing airlines to expand their route networks. ""We resumed the Narita flight with the approval of the then Biman Board,"" he added.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:06 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 08:46 AM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/travel/news/passenger-traffic-nears-twice-its-capacity-hsia-3894626","Passenger traffic nears twice its capacity at HSIA","  Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, the country's main aviation hub, is currently handling nearly twice its intended passenger capacity, leaving airport authorities struggling to maintain expected service standards. Originally designed to accommodate 8 million passengers annually, the airport handled nearly 12.5 million passengers, both domestic and international, in 2024, compared to 11.7 million in 2023, according to the outgoing executive director of HSIA, Group Captain Kamrul Islam. He was speaking at an event organised by the Aviation and Tourism Journalists' Forum of Bangladesh at the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters in the capital. The incoming Executive Director of HSIA, Group Captain SM Ragib Samad, was also present at the event. Despite political volatility last year, passenger traffic through HSIA rose by around 8 percent, primarily driven by the continued outbound flow of migrant workers. Authorities expect the situation to improve once the much-anticipated third terminal becomes operational by the end of this year. With the terminal, the airport will be able to handle more than 20 million passengers annually, leading to smoother operations and improved services. The added capacity will also allow more airlines to operate flights from Dhaka. Kamrul also highlighted that introducing accountability-based operations significantly improved passenger services at the country's busiest airport. ""We focused on ensuring accountability during my tenure. As a result, over 85 percent of baggage is now delivered to passengers within the standard time, monitored through automated tracking systems,"" he said. Kamrul projected that the aviation sector's contribution to Bangladesh's GDP could reach 5–6 percent within the next five years, up from less than 1 percent at present. Newly appointed Executive Director Group Captain Samad pledged to prioritise international-standard services for both passengers and cargo, with transparency and professionalism. ""An airport is the first impression of a country. It must reflect the highest standards,"" he said. The programme was presided over by ATJFB President Tanzim Anwar, while General Secretary Baten Biplob moderated the event.","Thu May 15, 2025 12:08 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 04:38 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/travel/news/family-travel-tips-bangladeshi-parents-3873811","Family travel tips for Bangladeshi parents","It can seem daunting, but once mastered, travelling with children can be quite rewarding. With thoughtful planning and strategic execution, potential stressors can turn into manageable tasks, ensuring a smooth family vacation filled with fun and unforgettable memories. Many parents worry that having children means the end of spontaneous travel, but it does not have to be. Exposing your children to new experiences as early as possible helps them adjust to travel easily. Being on the go from infancy can teach children adaptability, making them more comfortable in new environments. Selecting family-friendly locations is important. If your child is old enough, allow them a say in choosing your travel destination (within reason). This will give them an idea of what to expect during the journey. Involving them in planning gives them a sense of ownership and reduces anxiety. Look for destinations that offer attractions suitable for children and accommodations with kid-centric amenities like pools, playgrounds, and spacious suites to keep them entertained. It may be beneficial to take children to places you have been to before, as it gives you an advantage of having navigated the place and can cut your fear of missing out by quite a bit, too. One of the most important tips for travelling with kids is to pack smart, aiming for minimalism. Create a packing list to prevent over-packing! When travelling with babies, consider purchasing diapers, baby food, and other necessities at your destination to lighten your load. Focus on essential items like a few favourite toys, extra clothing, and snacks, allowing you to enjoy local shopping experiences. Use bright-coloured luggage to quickly identify your bags at the airport, scoop them up and move on. Use carry-ons as much as possible, or strollers that can be gate-checked if your baby is under two. Soft leashes (frowned upon as they are) can save you a few scares, especially by adventurous toddlers over that age. Long journeys can be tough, so keep a variety of entertainment options at hand, such as colouring books, puzzles, or a tablet with downloaded movies. Long-haul flights are not the time to be stringent with screen time — aim to use the screen as a distraction during flight times, substituting it for hands-on activities throughout the actual vacation. When travelling by air, make use of available amenities, like family check-in counters and on-board baby supplies like bassinets and hot water. Many airlines have services catered to families, helping you navigate the airport and board with ease. When possible, have one of the couple board first, stowing overhead luggage and making the space comfortable before the younger members arrive. Hunger can lead to hangry children, so keep a variety of snacks readily available during your travels. Many hotels can provide larger refrigerators, so call ahead to arrange this if possible, allowing you to stock up on essentials. While it is important to maintain your child's regular sleep schedule, you must also be flexible in your plans. Try to let your children nap around their usual times during vacations so that they feel more comfortable in new environments. But know that travel plans can change unexpectedly, so maintain a calm demeanour when things go awry. Your reactions can influence your children, so try to set a positive example. If travelling internationally, consider adding cushion days for acclimatisation. Gradually adjusting to a new time zone can significantly benefit young children, helping prevent jet lag and fostering a smoother transition. Similarly, if you are guilty of trying to cram too much into a trip, it may be wise to slow down. Travelling with kids is decidedly different from travelling solo. Children need breaks, so incorporate playtime at parks or local attractions, or even just let them go to the hotel pool for a few hours to allow them to unwind. This creates balance in their travel experience, ensuring they don't feel overwhelmed. For parents seeking some alone time, hiring a babysitter during your stay could allow for adult exploration. Look for trusted recommendations for babysitters through your hotel or friends. This opportunity can help you reconnect as a couple or enjoy a night out. If you are travelling with your baby for the first time, make the trip a short one and to a nearby location. Proximity to home can be reassuring, especially if things don't go according to plan or when they get overwhelming. Know that this is an experiment for both of you, so give each other grace along the journey.","Thu Apr 17, 2025 09:28 PM         Last update on: Thu Apr 17, 2025 09:41 PM"

The report, based on research by Canadian financial platform HelloSafe, found that average daily travel expenses in Laos are just 12.30 pounds sterling, including accommodation, meals and transport. This makes Laos a cheaper alternative to other Southeast Asian destinations such as Thailand and Indonesia. Kazakhstan and Rwanda were listed in second and third places, with average daily costs of 15.10 pounds and 16.60 pounds respectively. The study analysed prices in 131 countries. With its rich culture and stunning natural beauty, Laos offers visitors a range of attractions at a fraction of the cost of other popular locations. The ancient town of Luang Prabang, recognised as a World Heritage Site, is renowned for its beautiful temples. Additionally, the website highlights Vientiane, the capital city, where the iconic That Luang stupa attracts a large number of visitors each year. The Mekong River, which flows through the country, supports river cruises and other activities, while travellers can also explore waterfalls, caves and coffee plantations. In recent years, Laos has earned a growing recognition in global tourism rankings, with Luang Prabang often highlighted for its unique charm and strong destination management. Most recently, Luang Prabang won a 2025 Green Destinations Top 100 Story Award, placing third in the ""Destination Management"" category. The award honours success in inclusive tourism development and visitor management. In 2023, the province was named one of the world's 50 greatest places to visit by the US-based Time magazine, which described Luang Prabang as ""a hidden paradise"" known for its turquoise waterfalls, Buddhist temples, and sunset boat rides along the Mekong River. Luang Prabang also topped Lonely Planet's list of the best places to visit in Asia for 2025, ranking first among 22 destinations across the region. In 2024, more than 4.1 million foreign visitors travelled to Laos, an increase of 21 percent compared to the previous year. These visits generated over US$1 billion in revenue, according to the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism. This year, the government aims to attract at least 4.3 million international visitors, with tourist spending expected to exceed US$1 billion and an average length of stay of 10 days. Officials are also placing a strong emphasis on domestic tourism, targeting at least 4.1 million trips by Lao residents. This is projected to generate more than US$678 million, based on an average trip of three days.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/travel/news/avoid-the-eid-madness-4-peaceful-getaways-bangladesh-3858611","Avoid the Eid madness: 4 peaceful getaways in Bangladesh     ","Eid comes with smiles, happiness, and many plans on how to celebrate the special day. Many tend to make the best use of the festive holidays and travel across the country. Most places, however, are crowded during this time as everyone has the same idea and you cannot blame them. Here's an idea! Why don't you pick a spot that is spectacular all the same without all the hustle and bustle of the overflowing crowd? Here are 4 options you could try this Eid season to ditch the crowd. Known as ""China Matir Pahar"", it is a geologically interesting spot located at Bijoypur, Durgapur in Netrokona District. Situated in the Northern part of the country, this spectacular place stands near the Meghalayan border and, therefore, will allow you a glimpse of distant hills. The hills are not very high but will give you that taste of adventure and once you are on top, there's that beautiful view that one only gets from a height. There are several lakes nearby namely, the Blue Water Lake along the Hill whose water can only be described as a ""peaceful shade of blue"". It is uplifting, picturesque and, dare I say, really makes you wonder about the hidden beauty of nature that we even do not know exists! This place can be a great outing during Eid since the crowd here is little to nothing compared to other tourist spots. It can be a day trip and one can return home by the time the sun sets. From Dhaka, buses and trains are both available and trains will certainly be cheaper. Perhaps, you are craving nature's touch and think that a few hours on the sea beach will do the trick. Or, how about a walk through a mangrove forest? Cox's Bazar or Sundarbans are way too crowded and a little tranquillity is what you seek. So, why not Manpura Island? Yes, the same Manpura from the movie we all know of. The island is isolated from the mainland but it is part of Bhola District. With the Bay of Bengal on one side and the Meghna River on the other three, one can imagine how naturally appealing this place can be. There's a deer sanctuary, a mangrove forest, a sea beach and much more to explore. Being an isolated island, water vessels are your only option to go to the island. There are several launches from Dhaka Sadarghat. One can take the route via Barishal or Bhola as well. Sunamganj district has quite a few spots worth your interest and even if you are on a tight schedule, you can still make it work. You can make Niladri Lake your main objective and visit other points of interest on your way. Niladri Lake, also known as Shaheed Siraj Lake, sits in Tekerghat village, Tahirpur Upazila. With Tanguar Haor being not too far away, visitors often count it as a singular trip while visiting both locations. Small, beautiful stones scattered at a corner, the sight of the hills of Meghalaya visible at a distance is truly breath-taking. And getting here is not too difficult either. One can board a bus headed for Sunamganj from Dhaka and after that, it is just a matter of an autorickshaw ride that will take you to the lake. Located in the hilly district of Bandarban, both Boga Lake and Sangu River are spectacles of nature that bless us with not just their view but the serenity they bring to the mind. Sangu is arguably the most beautiful river in the country that curves through the lush hilly vegetation. A boat ride on the tranquil crystal-clear water will make you feel like you are piercing the surface at light speed, trying to catch that hill in the distance that always stays out of reach. Boga Lake, on the other hand, is a nature's whim that stands at a height of 1,246 feet from sea level. With verdant hills surrounding it, Boga Lake comes with its dragon mythology to match the breath-taking view of it. The stories seem straight out of an adventure novel and the fact that you have to get there by a vehicle called 'Chander Gari' only adds to it. One can stay at Boga Lake as there are cottages here. Boat rides should be on your to-do list and BBQ might just be the thing to match the celebratory mood. As the cherry on top, if you have the time and can manage it physically, you can also attempt a trek to Keokradong. Some of the spots can be physically demanding and long hours on the road might be a challenge for many. It is recommended that you pack accordingly, and keep essentials with you at all times. Try to hire a guide or someone local on your tour as it will make things so much easier for you. Look up on Google and YouTube about what to expect on your tour and how to prepare for them. You will also get a detailed instruction about how to get there and a rough idea about the expenses. Last but not least, try to have fun. Do not try to cramp too many places in a single day since it will wear you out and ruin the fun and you will end up feeling a lot worse the next morning. Travelling is supposed to be fun and try to keep it that way.","Thu Mar 27, 2025 05:19 AM         Last update on: Thu Mar 27, 2025 05:31 AM"

Luckily, with the right strategy, you can make it through your trip feeling refreshed instead of drained. A great tip for travelling while fasting is to schedule your flights, train rides, or long road trips during your eating window. For instance, start the trip either right after iftar or sehri so that you have the energy to carry on with the journey. If your flight is delayed while you are 8 hours into your fast, it is guaranteed to make the experience even more frustrating. Staying hydrated is crucial while fasting, and it becomes even more important when you are travelling. Drink lots of water throughout sehri or after breaking your fast, and eat meals high in water content such as soups, yoghurt, and fruits. Drinks high in electrolytes and coconut water might help you stay hydrated for longer. For a traveller who is fasting, maintaining a nutritious and balanced diet, eating in moderation, getting enough sleep, and engaging in physical activity are all ideal. Be sure to bring all of the medications you require and use on a regular basis, as well as a backup supply in case the place you are visiting does not have those available. You may need to quickly get a bite to eat for iftar or sehri while on the move since unexpected circumstances, such as delayed flights or traffic jams, can occur at any time. Pack some light food items such as dried fruits, granola, or a bag of nuts for these situations. A juice box and a bag of cookies can also be a good option to carry. When visiting a new city, do a little homework on nearby restaurants and food delivery services. There are halal, vegetarian, and fasting-friendly alternatives at many train stations and airports too. Preparing in advance guarantees a filling meal when it's time to eat. Pace yourself since long trips can be physically taxing. Until you are able to eat again, try to avoid vigorous exercise, take naps, and keep things light. Bring an eye mask and a neck pillow for extra comfort while travelling long distances. If you plan ahead of time, travelling while fasting does not have to be a stressful experience. To guarantee a relaxing and rewarding trip, drink plenty of water, pack lightly, and exercise flexibility. A little planning may go a long way toward keeping you motivated and focused while on the go.","Mon Mar 17, 2025 03:18 PM         Last update on: Mon Mar 17, 2025 03:39 PM"

This small, cube-shaped sweetmeat, with light sugar coatings and soft chhana inside, have been winning hearts for nearly 200 years. Its long history and unique taste make it a treasure of the district. The oldest shop in the area, Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar, located at Mahadev Potti, has been making chhanamukhi for almost 180 years. The story begins with Mahadev Panre, the founder of this famous sweet. He moved from Kashi to Kolkata with his brother, Durga Prasad. There, he began working in his brother's sweet shop and quickly became popular. After his brother's death, Mahadev moved to Brahmanbaria in search of work, where he found shelter at Shibram Modak's sweet shop. When Mahadev arrived, the fame of the shop grew. Before his passing, Shibram passed the shop to Mahadev. As a Brahman who never married, Mahadev later gave the shop to a nearby temple before his death. Today, four generations later, the shop is managed by Narayan Modak, continuing the legacy. The shop's recipe for chhanamukhi has stayed the same throughout the years. It is made with the same care and attention as it was in the beginning. This consistency has helped Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar retain its reputation as one of the best sweet shops in Brahmanbaria. The shop is surrounded by other confectioneries, many of which are run by the owner's relatives or close acquaintances. While chhanamukhi is the star of the show, Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar is also known for other specialities including taaler bora, roshmalai, jafran bhog, rajbhog, and ledikeni — a sweet with its own rich history, though it is no longer available. Sujit Madan, an employee working at the shop for 25 years, shares, ""Chhanamukhi is the best seller here. Our taaler bora and roshmalai are also fan favourites."" Gopal Sarkar, the skilled moira (the community known for making sweets) who has also been with the shop for 25 years, explains the process of making Chhanamukhi. He explained that the journey starts with fresh milk collected from village farmers. ""To make chhana, we boil pure milk, and about half an hour later, the curdled milk is separated, placed in a cloth, and tightly tied up to remove excess water. Once the chhana hardens, we cut it into pieces and dip them in sugar syrup,"" Sarkar explains. One kilogram of chhanamukhi costs Tk 700, which reflects the purity and effort involved. Sarkar adds, ""It takes 20 kilograms of milk to produce just 3 kilograms of chhana, which is why the price is high, but what you get is pure as a result."" Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar is a busy shop, operating from 7 AM to midnight. Despite many shops in the area, this shop continues to stand out as the birthplace of chhanamukhi. Simple yet rich in flavour, it continues to be a timeless favourite, enjoyed by generations. A visit to this iconic shop is a must for anyone wanting to explore the region. An interesting fact about chhanamukhi is that it has received Geographical Indication (GI) status in 2024, which means it is officially recognised as a special item from the region of Brahmanbaria.","Mon May 12, 2025 10:19 PM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 10:29 PM"

Blend the apples separately; strain. Now add honey and apple juice to the carrot juice and mix well. Chill this for an hour. Serve cold. Ingredients
 1 large piece of fresh ginger (about 3-4 inches) 4-5 lemons (freshly juiced) 2-3 tbsp honey or sweetener of choice (adjust to taste) Ice cubes (optional) Method Peel the fresh ginger root and cut it into small pieces. Grate the ginger with a little bit of water to create a smooth paste. Place the grated ginger in a fine sieve or cheesecloth, and press or squeeze it to extract the juice. You should have around 2-3 tablespoons of fresh ginger juice. Squeeze the juice from the lemons and strain it to remove seeds or pulp. In a large pitcher, combine the freshly squeezed lemon juice, ginger juice, and cold water. Stir well to mix. Add honey (or your preferred sweetener) to taste. Stir until it's dissolved completely. If you want a tangy flavour, feel free to adjust the amount of sweetener. Pour the ginger lemonade into glasses filled with ice cubes (optional). Ingredients
 5 cups diced watermelon ¾ cup raspberries 2 cups coconut water ¼ cup lime juice 2 tsp sugar Handful of mint leaves Method Firstly, dice up a watermelon to attain 5 cups of it. Blend this to get a fine juice and then strain this through a fine mesh sieve. Get rid of all the seeds and fruit pulp so that you are left with thin and translucent watermelon juice.   Next, cut raspberries into halves and puree them in a blender. After getting a fine puree, pass this through a sieve to get rid of all the seeds and solid substances. Add in 2 teaspoons of sugar to this and mix well. Squeeze a couple of limes and remove their seeds to get a 1/4 cup of lime juice.  Combine all these prepared ingredients together in a blender along with 2 cups of coconut water. Pulse them for a few seconds until you get a clear and homogenous mixture. You can adjust the level of sweetness by adding more sugar according to your taste preference. Lastly, chill this in the refrigerator and garnish with a sprig of mint before serving to add a pop of colour and a burst of freshness. This tastes best when served cold.","Sun May 11, 2025 07:25 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 07:32 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/food-recipes/news/dhakas-food-map-exploring-regional-culinary-gems-3887391","Dhaka's food map: Exploring regional culinary gems","The food scene in the city is as diverse as its people and just as expressive. And by expressive, I mean deeply personal. Food here is not just something we eat — it's something we are! In Dhaka, you don't need to scale hills or cross rivers to taste the country's rich regional delicacies. You just need to be hungry. Why? Because, no matter where you are from, there's probably a corner that smells of your childhood. This is the metropolis's secret superpower. For a city that's relentlessly fast, loud, and crowded enough to make anyone consider monastic life, it has a surprisingly tender culinary soul. It doesn't just feed you — it reminds you who you are. This humble black gram flour (mashkalai-er-aata) flatbread from Chapainawabganj — usually served with mashed aubergine, garlic chutney, or spicy beef — is not exactly standard restaurant fare. Kalai ruti is rustic, it's intense, and it unapologetically smells like the northern districts. And yet, hidden among the glittering restaurant strips of Dhaka, you will find little joints that specialise in it — places that know how one bite can teleport a homesick migrant right back to their village rooftop. At ""Kalai Rutir Adda"" in Khilgaon, owner Rabiul Islam tells us the same with a smile, ""As a business major student, I always knew I wanted to start something — I just didn't know what. Then came 2020. The world hit pause. Travel stopped, and suddenly, I found myself craving kalai ruti. I'm from Rajshahi — and that taste, that warmth, it's part of who we are. ""Ask anyone from Rajshahi, Dinajpur, or back home — they'll say the same. So, I started making it here, just for a bite of nostalgia. That's how ""Kalai Rutir Adda"" came to life — from a craving, turned comfort, turned calling."" Mezban is not just a meal to Chittagonians. It's a ritual. A reunion. A heartfelt excuse to gather, make amends, share news, or simply remind someone they still matter. For Chittagonians, mezban is not served — it's felt. Shahidul Islam, the owner of ""Nawab Chatga"", opened his eatery in Dhaka with that same emotion in heart — to serve mezban that actually tastes like mezban. Not a watered-down version, not an imitation, but the bold, fiery dish he grew up eating in the heart of Chattogram. ""I once went to a restaurant in Bashundhara,"" he recalls. ""They served something they called mezban, but it wasn't even close. It felt like someone had just read about mezban in a textbook and guessed the recipe."" That moment made him ponder. If that's what people in the capital thought mezban was, someone had to set the record straight. ""After leaving my corporate career, the idea of opening a Bengali restaurant in Dhaka kept coming back to me,"" he shares. ""I just knew — if anyone was going to do justice to the authentic flavours of my home, it had to be me."" At ""Nawab Chatga"", authenticity is not a marketing line — it's a promise. Shahidul ensures his spices are sourced straight from Hathazari Bazar. The beef? Cooked slowly and steadily, the traditional way — in clay ovens over wood fires. No shortcuts. No compromises. Just deep, unapologetic Chittagonian flavour, served with pride. ""It has to taste like home,"" he says simply. And it does. Dhaka also brings the hills to the table, offering fresh, herbaceous flavours from the Hill Tracts, where indigenous recipes add a whole new dimension to the city's food scene. Their flavours are as bold as the terrain they come from. One such eatery is Hebang, an indigenous restaurant run by four sisters, where the air is thick with the earthy scent of bamboo shoots and slow-cooked meats. The journey of the restaurant began modestly in 2016, when the sisters started taking online orders, encouraged by university dorm friends who could not get enough of their home-cooked meals. ""They gave us the push,"" says Biply Chakma, one of the co-founders. ""What began in our kitchen turned into something we never expected."" By 2018, Hebang had opened a physical space, and soon, diners from across the city — not just from indigenous communities — began coming to experience the clean, understated flavours of the hills. Maybe that's what makes Dhaka's food scene so special — living here means falling in love with dishes you did not grow up with, discovering unfamiliar flavours, untold stories, and finding a sense of home in every bite. One day, you are chasing a taste from your childhood, and the next, you are craving something you only tried last year but now cannot imagine life without. And that's the magical part. Dhaka does not just feed you — it connects you. To your roots, to each other, and to the beautiful, ever-growing mosaic of this city we all call home.","Mon May 5, 2025 06:24 PM         Last update on: Mon May 5, 2025 06:38 PM"

Among them, one stands above the rest — Kheerpuri. This particular sweet has become a symbol of Madaripur, drawing visitors from all over Bangladesh. No trip to the town is complete without tasting it, and no one leaves the town without taking some home for their loved ones. Among the many sweet shops in Madaripur, one name stands out: Jibon Mistanno Bhandar. This legendary shop has been serving sweets for almost 80 years. Located at Old Court, it is a must-visit place for anyone with a love for sweets. Their Kheerpuri is the most popular, but their Roshogolla, Roshmalai, and Chhanar Jilapi are equally loved by the locals. The story of Jibon Mistanno Bhandar began in the 1930s when the man behind the venture, Jibon Mondal opened the shop. He started with just Roshogolla, but as time passed, Kheerpuri became the shop's signature sweet. Later, his son Kanai Mondal took charge and continued the tradition. Now, Jibon's grandson Akash Mondal is running the shop as the third generation. The shop, once small and simple, has now become a well-known spot in Madaripur, attracting both locals and visitors. ""Kheerpuri is made with fresh milk brought from our village every day,"" Mondal shares as he explains the procedure. First, kheer (thickened milk) is prepared with slow heat and simmered for hours until it reaches the perfect creamy consistency. Then, this smooth, creamy kheer is brought to room temperature and carefully poured over a layer of chhana. The result is a perfectly balanced, mildly sweet delight that tastes just right. Every day, the shop sells about 20 to 30 kgs of Kheerpuri. Each piece costs Tk 30, and one kg is Tk 650. But what makes Jibon Mistanno Bhandar's Kheerpuri so special? According to Mondal, the secret lies in the quality of the ingredients and the traditional cooking process. ""Every single day, the milk used is sourced from our own village, and we follow the same method my grandfather used decades ago. That's why our Kheerpuri tastes the same today as it did years ago,"" Mondal explains. While Kheerpuri is the most famous, it is not the only star at their shop. Sourov, one of the employees, proudly shares, ""Our Roshogolla is very popular too. And many people love our Chhanar Jilapi."" My friend and I had the opportunity to taste their sweets. We started with the roshogolla — it was warm, soft, and simply melted in our mouths. Then, we tried the chhanar jilapi, which was equally delicious, with a caramelised outer layer, and a soft, juicy inside. The sweetness was perfectly balanced — not overpowering at all. But when we tasted the kheerpuri, it was magic! The creamy texture and the right amount of sweetness made us fall in love with it instantly. It was neither too sweet nor too heavy — just the perfect balance of taste and texture. Before leaving, we bought a box of kheerpuri to take home, confident that our families would love it just as much as we did. Jibon Mistanno Bhandar opens its doors at 7 AM and stays open until 10 PM. Throughout the day, locals and visitors come to enjoy their favourite sweets. Whether it's a festival, a family gathering, or just a regular day, people of Madaripur love visiting this shop to satisfy their sweet cravings. Regular local customers, some of whom have been visiting for decades, express that the sweets bring back childhood memories. Jibon Mistanno Bhandar is more than just a sweet shop — it is a part of Madaripur's identity. Its legacy of quality and taste has been passed down for three generations, making it a symbol of tradition. If you ever visit Madaripur, don't forget to stop by and taste the famous Kheerpuri. You'll surely take some home, just like we did!","Thu Apr 17, 2025 09:05 PM         Last update on: Thu Apr 17, 2025 09:13 PM"

She's officially the first Thai and Asian female chef to be crowned The World's Best Female Chef 2025. Whenever we think of high-end kitchens, our minds go straight to a stressed-out chef like Gordon Ramsay, with a whisk in one hand and a temper in the other! But along comes Pam, serving history and heritage with finesse and proving the world-class kitchen doesn't need to be a warzone — it can be a celebration. Pam was born and raised in Bangkok. She sharpened her knives at the Culinary Institute of America and even did a stint at New York's famed Jean-Georges before returning home to ignite the Bangkok dining scene. She first launched The Table, an intimate private dining experience that built her local cred, before dropping the big one in 2021 — Potong. Pam is the chef-patron of the Michelin-starred Potong, currently ranked Number 13 on Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2025 and 57 on the World's 50 Best Restaurants 2024. Potong is in her family's former Chinese herbal medicine shophouse. It blends Thai-Chinese roots with bold innovation, and yes — a five-story building of beautifully preserved Sino-Portuguese architecture from 1910! But Pam's culinary empire is far from one-note. Her latest venture, Khao San Sek, is just a five-minute walk from Potong. The name ""Khao San Sek"" means 'sacred milled rice'— the bits that fall to the ground during milling and are blessed by monks. In Thai culture, it's considered ""lucky rice,"" used to ward off evil spirits. She handed over the reins to her former Potong sous-chef, Grace. Potong is a temple to sacred Thai ingredients — and no, not the usual green curry and pad thai. It's focused on the soul of Thai cuisine, with the five key elements: rice, chilli, coconut, fish sauce, and palm sugar. Coming this July, she's lighting the fire again with Ra-u, a bold new Thai grill house opening at Siam Paragon. Here, the name, which means ""heat"" in Thai, reflects both the fire of the grill and the heat of Thai spices. Together with her husband Tor Boonpiti, Pam also co-founded The X Project — a boundary-pushing hospitality group that now boasts 10 restaurants and bars across Bangkok, including Tora Izakaya and the swanky Opium Bar (73 on Asia's 50 Best Bars 2024). Safe to say, they're redefining Bangkok's culinary and nightlife scene, one bold concept at a time. Outside the kitchen, Chef Pam is a familiar face on TV, judging on Top Chef Thailand, Top Chef Arab World, Iron Chef, and more. But she's also using her platform for good — founding the WFW (Women For Women) Scholarship and Internship Programme in 2024, dedicated to mentoring and empowering young Thai women in the culinary arts. The World's Best Female Chef 2025 title is the first of many accolades to be announced ahead of the World's 50 Best Restaurants awards ceremony, taking place 19 June, in Turin, Italy. Until then, we'll be over here dreaming of sacred rice, grilled meats, and what's next from Bangkok's boldest kitchen queen.","Thu Apr 10, 2025 04:50 PM         Last update on: Thu Apr 10, 2025 04:54 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/summers-back-are-you-drinking-enough-water-3894466","Summer's back: Are you drinking enough water?","In this hot and humid weather, maintaining proper hydration and energy levels is vital for overall health and well-being. Drinking a sufficient amount of water during summer can be challenging; therefore, it is important to adopt beneficial habits that help us stay hydrated throughout the season. Here are some expert-backed ways to navigate summer with ease, ensuring optimal hydration during this period: It is advised to pre-hydrate before starting your day rather than waiting until the evening to catch up on water intake. A few days before the peak of summer, adjusting your drinking habits can also help you cope better with the heat. Drinking water consistently throughout the day is essential. It's also a good idea to carry a water bottle with you wherever you go. If you're tired of plain water, try flavoured drinks or include foods with high water content—such as watermelon, cucumbers, and citrus fruits. Adding water-rich fruits and vegetables to your meals is highly beneficial. A glass of lemon water with a pinch of salt can be refreshing, or try infusing water with natural flavours like lemon slices, ginger, mint, or cucumber. Ramadan might be over, but don't underestimate the power of dates! They're rich in natural sugars and electrolytes, making them an excellent hydrating snack. Dates also provide a quick energy boost—perfect for sluggish summer afternoons. Use ingredients like coconut water, bananas, spinach, and almonds to create electrolyte-rich beverages that replenish fluids lost through sweating. Watch out for common dehydration triggers such as sugary beverages, salty foods, fried foods, and excessive caffeine. These increase urine output and can lead to excessive thirst and dehydration.   The writer is the Chief Clinical Dietitian and Head of the Dietetics and Nutrition Department at United Hospital.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/perimenopause-and-menopause-understanding-the-hormonal-journey-3892236","Perimenopause and menopause: Understanding the hormonal journey ","Menopause is not a singular event. It is part of a broader continuum of change that begins years before the final menstrual period and continues long after. Understanding this passage, beginning with perimenopause, can turn confusion into clarity, and fear into empowerment. Across Bangladesh and much of the world, women often enter the perimenopausal stage of life with little awareness and even less preparation. Conversations around it are scarce, cloaked in discomfort and cultural silence. Yet this transition — a complex hormonal and emotional shift — touches nearly every aspect of a woman's life, from her physical wellbeing to her psychological stability and sense of identity. ""My sleep was a mess, I kept forgetting things, and my heart would race for no reason. For months, I thought I had an anxiety disorder or early dementia. It never crossed my mind that it could be perimenopause"" Menopause doesn't arrive all at once. Dr Syeda Husna Akhter, Senior Consultant Gynaecology and Obstetrics at Super Specialized Hospital, Dhaka, explains, ""There's a transitional stage called the climacteric. It includes perimenopause, the early shift, and post-menopause, which follows after periods have permanently stopped."" Perimenopause typically begins in a woman's early to mid-40s, though some experience symptoms earlier. It can last anywhere from a few months to over a decade. During this time, oestrogen, the hormone responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle, mood, and reproductive health, fluctuates unpredictably. This hormonal imbalance affects the brain, heart, bones, and even digestion. ""You might have irregular periods, or go two or three months without one, and then suddenly get two in a single month,"" says Dr Akhter. ""The ovaries begin to reduce their hormone response, but not all at once. That's why the symptoms can be so erratic."" ""I was snapping at my children for no reason, crying during meetings, and waking up at 3 AM every night. I thought I was just burned out."" Many women initially misattribute their experiences, describing it as a period of ""emotional short-circuiting."" In truth, they are going through a biological transformation that affects every woman, yet is rarely explained well. The range of symptoms can be broad and deeply personal. From sudden heat in the face and chest — hot flashes — to insomnia, depression, vaginal dryness, brain fog, digestive trouble, and loss of libido, the body starts to send signals that many find hard to interpret. ""Hot flashes are a hallmark symptom,"" says Dr Akhter. ""They usually last two to three minutes and cause the face and upper body to flush. For some women, they're barely noticeable; for others, they disrupt sleep and work. Stress and lifestyle factors can worsen them."" Psychological symptoms are just as common. Mood swings, irritability, or even unexplained grief can descend without warning. Hormones regulate the reproductive system and the brain. As oestrogen drops, women can feel mentally unbalanced, like they're not themselves anymore. ""I thought pregnancies cannot happen if periods are months apart"" One common misconception is that once periods become irregular, fertility ends, but that's not necessarily true. A largely unspoken aspect of this life stage is its impact on intimacy and sexual health. Vaginal dryness, discomfort during intercourse, and reduced desire are all common but rarely addressed. ""After oestrogen declines, the vaginal lining thins and loses elasticity,"" explains Dr Akhter. ""This can cause painful sex, urinary discomfort, or even cystitis. Many women suffer in silence because they don't know this is connected to menopause."" Dr Akhter encourages women to speak up and seek help. ""These are natural changes, and they can be managed – either through lifestyle, topical treatments, or in certain cases, hormone therapy."" In Bangladesh, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed conservatively due to potential side effects. ""We try to start with non-medical solutions,"" says Dr Akhter. ""Good sleep, regular exercise, a calcium-rich diet, and emotional support go a long way."" She adds, ""If symptoms become unmanageable — severe insomnia, mood crashes, unbearable hot flashes — we do consider HRT but only in minimal doses and with close monitoring. Side effects like breast tenderness, irregular bleeding, or reduced breast firmness can occur."" ""I would cry in the shower and then walk into the office like nothing happened. I didn't even know it was hormonal"" For those without access to specialists, the first line of treatment is often understanding and reassurance. ""The role of psychological support is huge,"" says Dr Akhter. ""Sometimes, women just need to hear that what they're experiencing is normal and that it will pass."" Despite its inevitability, menopause remains a topic shrouded in discomfort. In South Asian households, where women's identities are still tied closely to reproductive roles, this transition is viewed as a loss rather than an evolution. ""Menopause doesn't mean a woman's value has ended,"" says Dr Akhter firmly. ""It's a time for reflection, for shifting priorities, and embracing maturity with strength."" Hossain puts it best: ""I thought menopause would mean life slowing down. But instead, it gave me clarity. I stopped worrying about monthly cycles and started focusing on myself. I only wish I had known more about what to expect."" Perimenopause and menopause are not medical tragedies; rather, they are deeply human transitions. With education, support, and agency, women can reclaim this stage not as a decline, but as a redefining of their lives. ""Menopause is not a disease,"" Dr Akhter emphasises. ""It's a phase. With the right tools — physical, emotional, and social — women can move through it with dignity."" In a country like Bangladesh, where health conversations are still layered with stigma, breaking the silence around menopause is not just necessary — it's liberating. Because every woman deserves to understand her body, and every woman deserves to feel whole, even as she changes.","Sun May 11, 2025 07:33 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 07:39 PM"

That means I can enjoy music, soak in nature, increase my step count, and burn fat simultaneously.​ Zone 2 cardio involves exercising at 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate, a level where you can maintain a conversation but not sing. It's the sweet spot where your body efficiently burns fat and enhances aerobic capacity without undue strain. Think speed walking rather than running.​ Engaging in Zone 2 cardio offers a multitude of health benefits:​ Enhanced fat metabolism: Training in this zone optimises the body's ability to utilise fat as a primary energy source, aiding in weight management and metabolic health.​ Improved mitochondrial function: Regular Zone 2 exercise increases the number and efficiency of mitochondria, the energy powerhouses of our cells, leading to better endurance and energy levels.​ Cardiovascular health: It strengthens the heart muscle, improves circulation, and can lower the risk of heart disease.​ Mental wellbeing: The moderate intensity promotes the release of endorphins, reducing stress and enhancing mood.​ Sustainable fitness: Unlike high-intensity workouts, Zone 2 training is gentler on the joints and muscles, making it suitable for individuals of all ages and fitness levels.​ Zone 2 cardio not only promotes fat burning during exercise but also extends fat oxidation beyond the workout session. This moderate-intensity training enhances mitochondrial efficiency, enabling your body to utilise fat as a primary energy source for longer periods. As a result, you experience sustained energy levels and improved metabolic flexibility throughout the day.​ Moreover, Zone 2 training helps regulate cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone. Unlike high-intensity workouts that can cause significant cortisol spikes, potentially leading to increased fat storage, muscle breakdown, and disrupted sleep, Zone 2 cardio maintains cortisol levels within a healthy range. This balance supports better recovery, hormonal harmony, and overall well-being.​ Incorporating Zone 2 cardio into your routine does not require expensive equipment or gym memberships. Aim for at least 150 minutes of Zone 2 cardio spread throughout the week. Consistency is key. Here are some accessible ways to get started:​ Brisk walking: A 30–60-minute walk at a pace where you can talk but not sing.​ Cycling: Riding at a steady, moderate pace on flat terrain.​ Swimming: Continuous laps at a comfortable speed.​ Dancing: Engaging in any dance form that elevates your heart rate moderately.​ So, next time you are in the park, remember: you're not just relaxing — you're investing in your health.   The author is a writer and yogini.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/work-habits-harm-your-heart-health-3872591","Work habits that harm your heart health","In a world filled with daily stress and deadlines, we often forget the impact of unhealthy workplace habits on our health, particularly the health of our heart and cardiovascular system. Most of us tend to sit for long periods at the desk in a sedentary manner and forget just how badly these habits can harm us over time. If you are worried about the consequences of these actions and are looking to improve your lifestyle for the betterment of your cardiovascular health, take the step towards making a change today! Sitting at your desk and working long hours without any breaks is a common but extremely unhealthy workplace habit. Not only does this form of inactivity raise the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure, but it also increases the chances of developing obesity. In fact, sitting too long allows blood to pool and not burn energy effectively. Therefore, the more you sit, the less work your heart does, weakening its system for years to come. Workplace stress is one of the most common health threats to our hearts. Short timelines, performance pressure, and unresolved conflicts accelerate the release of cortisol into the body. Cortisol is a hormone that affects your metabolism by assisting the usage of glucose in your body for energy. When the levels are consistently elevated in the bloodstream due to stress, it may cause prolonged hypertension, inflammation, and vascular damage, which can prove fatal in the long run. Due to a shortage of time or financial constraints, lunchtime with unhealthy snacks or fast-food orders has nowadays become a habit at work. However, in the long run, this could be extremely disastrous. High cholesterol levels from saturated fats, sweets, and processed meals shrink blood vessels and block blood flow to the heart. This build-up increases the likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke. Moreover, eating during stress or on a tight schedule only aggravates the problem. Long work hours and deadlines may disrupt our sleep cycles. Lack of sleep raises the risk of heart disease through increased blood pressure and a weakened immune system. The more sleep deprived your body is, the more pressure it is under to cope with the stress that you encounter on a daily basis, which eventually leads to an increase in the strain that your heart is under. Keep in mind that it does not need to be complicated to exclude some of the bad habits in your lifestyle. It will be possible to take care of the heart and create a healthier work-life balance by making healthier choices through moving more, stressing less, eating well, and sleeping enough. Begin by starting to move! Whether it means setting an alarm to stand and stretch or going for a brisk walk during your lunch hour every day, regular movement means good circulation as it lowers blood pressure and all those risks associated with sitting. Stress management is the next step. There is a whole bunch of techniques provided by mindfulness, high-priority deep breathing exercises, meditation, or at least taking short breaks every now and then to recharge. You may also want to have a chat with your manager about possible changes in the workload or tactics to complete your responsibilities faster. Stress reduction does not just make your heart healthier; it brings with it productive work and job satisfaction. Now comes healthy eating and sleeping. Meal prep can be a healthy solution to tackle a nutritious diet. You can bring healthy snacks and lunches to work, such as foods rich in fibre, healthy fats, and antioxidants. You should also prepare a specific sleeping time to abide by every night to get at least six hours of sleep. No matter how difficult it is to navigate your schedule, you will only wake up feeling healthier the next day.","Wed Apr 16, 2025 05:27 PM         Last update on: Wed Apr 16, 2025 05:37 PM"

From the humble bottle gourd to the rich ruhi fish, the array of local vegetables, lentils, fruits, and nuts serves as natural healers, and we have brought you 7 names to your doorstep that can help improve your cardiac health. Red lentil is a household staple — if there is nothing to eat with white rice, just add some cooked red lentils and enjoy. Being the ideal plant protein, it's also ideal for the heart: folate protects it, iron helps in RBC formation, and potassium helps against hypertension. The fibre in it prevents cholesterol from clogging our arteries. This mildly sweet vegetable is delectable food that can aid heart health. The high water and fibre content help in weight management. Be it used in a curry or red lentils, it will make your heart sing all the way. The hawkers ferrying this crunchy brown delicacy on the streets might not look too much to offer at first glance, but in reality, one handful does wonders. It helps in reducing LDL, the so-called ""bad cholesterol"", keeps the endothelium in arteries from inflammation, and decreases diabetes risk, which in fact affects the heart too. Whether cucumber is a fruit or a vegetable is up for debate, but one thing is for sure: it's a cool food to have. Cucumber contains flavonoids, which help prevent blood clots in the heart, and low sodium does not spike your blood pressure. It's delicious, inexpensive, and provides for a person's daily potassium needs. What's best is that its natural sugars give you energy minus the cholesterol, making it the number one choice after a good workout. If you have been eyeing the bunch of bananas sitting in your pantry, don't be afraid to do yourself a favour with their greatness. The freshwater fish comes with an array of pros and little to no cons. The omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation, maintain lower triglyceride levels, and ensure blood vessels are well functioning. The benefits of onions go far beyond the kitchen drama. Packed with antioxidants and sulphur compounds, onions reduce blood cholesterol and lower the risk of stroke. While eating it raw offers the most perks, adding it to your curry and dishes will do the trick!","Wed Apr 16, 2025 05:13 PM         Last update on: Wed Apr 16, 2025 05:29 PM"

I kept it private to avoid judgment, the whispers calling me 'defective' for not conceiving naturally. In India, I saw women in their 50s enduring the same gruelling treatments, all longing to hold a child. People do not understand our pain; they only expect us to have children, as if that's our sole purpose."" — Rumana, 35, while reflecting on her recent IVF success. In Bangladesh, where motherhood is deeply woven into a woman's identity, infertility is more than just a medical condition — it is a deeply entrenched social stigma. For many women, being unable to conceive means being treated as incomplete, facing emotional abuse, and even experiencing violence. While scientific advancements have led to Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) such as In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), these treatments remain largely inaccessible, expensive, and shrouded in misinformation. According to a study ""Infertility and Assisted Reproduction as Violent Experiences for Women in Bangladesh: Arts-based Intervention to Address GBV (Arts for I-ARTs)"" by Dr Papreen Nahar and Farhana Alam, infertile women in Bangladesh often experience a form of social exile, where they are treated as incomplete, inadequate, or even cursed.  According to Dr Nahar, an expert in global health and infection at the University of Sussex, infertility leads to serious social and emotional consequences for women in Bangladesh. ""Being childless can have severe impacts, including family violence, social stigma, emotional abuse, and financial difficulties. Infertility is not included in public health policies, and there are few public services to support childless women. As a result, many turn to ARTs, but these procedures often expose them to further harm, including lack of informed consent, painful and intrusive treatments, and even life-threatening risks."" Research suggests that 15 per cent of Bangladeshi women struggle with infertility, the highest rate in South Asia. The emotional toll is immense, with many women experiencing depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Women who seek medical help often find themselves blamed and judged rather than supported. At the same time, women endure constant pressure from their families and communities. Many are pushed into traditional healing practices before seeking medical help, while others are pressured into arranged second marriages for their husbands, worsening their emotional trauma. Infertility treatments in Bangladesh remain prohibitively expensive. Dr Farhana Anam, a fertility specialist and the Medical Director of Harvest Infertility, highlights that while ARTs can solve many fertility issues, access remains limited due to financial constraints. ""IVF and IUI treatments are extremely expensive and unaffordable for most families. Many women remain unaware of their options or lack the autonomy to seek help. A major barrier is also the shortage of trained specialists and regulations to ensure quality care."" The high cost of ARTs exacerbates the inequalities faced by infertile women. Many families exhaust their life savings in pursuit of pregnancy only to be met with failed treatments, financial ruin, and social humiliation. Infertility is often framed as a women's issue in most cases, despite medical evidence showing that male infertility contributes to at least 50 per cent of infertility cases worldwide. However, due to deeply entrenched patriarchal beliefs, male infertility is rarely acknowledged, let alone discussed openly. Women bear the brunt of the blame, while their husbands and male family members escape scrutiny. According to the study ""Infertility and Assisted Reproduction as Violent Experiences for Women in Bangladesh: Arts-based Intervention to Address GBV (Arts for I-ARTs),"" infertile women in Bangladesh are often blamed for a couple's inability to conceive, regardless of medical evidence. Even when male infertility is confirmed, women are pressured to remain silent to ""protect the man's dignity"" and uphold family honour. The study highlights a critical gap in knowledge about male reproductive health in Bangladesh. Frequently, male infertility is not diagnosed early because men and their families often refuse to accept the possibility that infertility could be due to low sperm count, poor sperm motility, or other reproductive issues. Dr Sabina Faiz Rashid, Director of the Center of Excellence for Gender, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (CGSRHR) at BRAC University, explains, ""We live in a patriarchal society where men are rarely held accountable. Even when male infertility is recognised, families – and often wives – conceal it to protect the man and the family's honour. As a result, women bear the burden alone, facing social stigma and ridicule."" This lack of accountability reinforces misconceptions about infertility and further isolates affected women. Men are rarely asked to undergo medical tests, while their wives are subjected to numerous diagnostic procedures and treatments without questioning the possibility that their husbands could be infertile.  A growing body of research, including that of Dr Papreen Nahar and Farhana Alam, argues that infertility-related discrimination should be recognised as a form of gender-based violence (GBV). The justice framework of reproductive health argues that women must have the right to access affordable fertility treatment, mental health care, and protection from stigma and violence. One promising intervention is the use of art to address infertility-related GBV. Dr Nahar highlights that art can help women heal, advocate for their rights, and challenge societal norms. ""Art-based interventions can be especially powerful in addressing gender-based violence related to infertility. Theatre, documentaries, and storytelling can communicate women's struggles in ways that traditional advocacy cannot, breaking taboos and fostering empathy."" Participatory art programmes can provide safe spaces for women to express their pain, reclaim their voices, and inspire collective action against infertility stigma. In our society, the expectation of motherhood is deeply ingrained, shaping a woman's identity from the moment she is married. Infertile women are not only seen as incomplete but also ignored in social circles and subjected to verbal abuse and emotional neglect. This dehumanisation must change. Dr Rashid emphasises the urgency of redefining womanhood beyond childbirth, stating, ""There is a deeply rooted belief that a woman's primary duty is to give birth. This thinking needs to change. Women are more than their ability to conceive. Society must recognise and celebrate their achievements, intelligence, and contributions beyond motherhood."" Therefore, it is high time for us to rewrite the narrative on infertility, moving from shame to support, from exclusion to inclusion, and from silence to empowerment. Special thanks to Dr Papreen Nahar (Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex), Dr Sabina Faiz Rashid (BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health, BRAC University), and Dr Farhana Anam (Harvest Infertility) for their invaluable insights.

But with the rising temperatures, dehydration can become an unexpected challenge, especially after long fasting hours. While indulging in festive delicacies, it's essential to prioritise hydration — both for energy and overall well-being. From water-rich fruits to refreshing drinks, making smart choices can ensure that your Eid is both delicious and revitalizing. This Ramadan, thirst is perhaps a bigger concern than hunger, for most. As acutely felt as it is, most people do not track their liquid consumption, and the result is dehydration and related health issues. From maintaining the right balance of electrolytes to providing the right nutrients, the role of water is crucial! Thus, after continuous fasting, halfway through the month, you may find yourself constantly parched and dehydrated. Forgetting to drink enough fluids during Ramadan is hardly uncommon, given that most of the non-fast time is also the time we sleep. So, how do you stay hydrated during Ramadan? The simplest solution — drink plenty of water! Break your fast with at least one glass, and keep sipping throughout the night. Avoid chugging too much at once. Finally, drink around two glasses of water during sehri to stay hydrated throughout the day. If you are not a fond of drinking water, don't worry! There are plenty of fruits and vegetables with high water content that you could try instead. Opt for fruits like watermelons, and oranges or finish your iftar with vegetable soup. Alternatively, put a few lemon slices or mint leaves into your water for a fresh, subtle flavour. No matter how much of a coffee-addict or a tea-lover you are, Ramadan is the time to refrain from these! Stimulant drinks act as diuretics and can cause dehydration faster. If you are worried about weight gain during Ramadan, stay away from calorie-rich sugary drinks during iftar and stick to plain lemon water or cucumber water! Our body can be dehydrated due to excess sweating while travelling in hot and humid weather and surroundings. Oral rehydration saline can be of great use in this regard. We often forget about this simple measure. Alternatively, take plenty of liquid like water, green coconut water, juice etc. while heading home for a joyous Eid. Be careful about drinking safe water and a good source of liquids like juice and drinks, otherwise, they can be harmful causing diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases. Eid in the summer calls for a feast that balances indulgence with hydration. Traditional dishes like biryani, korma, and kebabs are essential, but it's equally important to include cooling foods and drinks. Fresh fruit platters, yogurt-based drinks like borhani, and refreshing sherbets help beat the heat while aiding digestion. Hydration is key after a month of fasting, so sipping on infused water, coconut water, or lemonade throughout the day can prevent dehydration. A well-rounded Eid feast not only satisfies the taste buds but also keeps the body refreshed and energised in the summer heat.","Thu Mar 27, 2025 05:13 AM         Last update on: Thu Mar 27, 2025 05:19 AM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/fasting-ulcers-guide-safe-and-comfortable-ramadan-3856886","Fasting with ulcers: A guide to a safe and comfortable Ramadan","For millions of Muslims around the world, fasting during Ramadan is a deeply spiritual practice. However, for those suffering from stomach ulcers, prolonged fasting can sometimes lead to discomfort and health complications. The good news is that with mindful dietary choices, fasting can still be manageable and beneficial. By avoiding spicy, acidic, and processed foods while opting for nourishing, slow-digesting meals, ulcer sufferers can reduce symptoms and maintain their well-being throughout the holy month. This guide offers essential dietary recommendations to help you fast comfortably while keeping your digestive health in check. An open peptic ulcer is a lesion in the upper digestive tract. Stomach or gastric ulcers form when the thick mucus layer that protects the stomach from digestive juices breaks down, resulting the stomach lining tissues being eroded by digestive acids. The most common symptom is a burning or aching sensation between the chest and the belly button. It usually lasts from a few minutes to many hours when your stomach is empty. Symptoms of stomach ulcers include bloating, burping, acid reflux, and heartburn (burning sensation in the chest). Discomfort decreases with food and drink. So, throughout Ramadan, try to keep the following diet recommendations to avoid discomfort. Fried, greasy, and acidic meals and fruits (citrus fruits such as lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges). Spicy meals and canned/processed foods, particularly tomato-based products. Many processed foods include a high concentration of chemicals, including preservatives, which may aggravate gastritis. Foods high in sugar and processed carbs. Overeating at the break of fast, or during sehri. Caffeine-containing beverages such as tea, coffee, sodas, etc. These cause you to flow more urine, which contains vital mineral salts that your body requires during the long day of fasting. Smoking has been linked to gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. Ramadan is an excellent time to quit smoking. Consuming carbohydrates or slow-digesting food at sehri so that the food lasts longer, making you less hungry and more active for the rest of the day. Breaking your fast with dates, which are high in sugar, fibre, carbs, potassium, and magnesium. Eating oven-grilled dishes instead of fried or fatty ones. Adding bananas to your Ramadan diet, as they are high in carbs, potassium, and magnesium.  Protein and fibre are abundant in almonds. A nutritious drink made with ground almonds and milk is a must during iftar. Eating in moderation and smaller portions, and break the fast as soon as possible. Not missing your prescribed medications at sehri while fasting. Drinking as much water, non-acidic fruit juices, and potassium-containing liquids as possible between dusk and dawn, so that your body can regulate fluid levels for the next day.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/the-tragic-fate-stray-animals-japan-garden-city-3759541","#Perspective / The tragic fate of stray animals in Japan Garden City ","In a heart-breaking incident at Japan Garden City, Mohammadpur several stray dogs and cats lost their lives after consuming poisoned food. These animals, often left to survive independently, placed their trust in the hands of individuals who pretended to offer them kindness. Instead, the deceit led to their tragic deaths, leaving animal lovers and activists devastated. Stray animals, especially in cities and towns, are vulnerable to hunger and rely heavily on the goodwill of humans for survival. The poisoned food they consumed likely seemed like a lifeline to them—an act of compassion that turned out to be a cruel betrayal. Reports from the area suggest that the animals ate the food without hesitation, unknowingly consuming their death. This incident raises serious concerns about the safety and welfare of stray animals in Bangladesh. While some citizens and organisations work tirelessly to rescue and protect strays, there remain individuals who view these creatures as a nuisance rather than as beings deserving of care and respect. The poisoning of these innocent animals is not just an act of cruelty; it is a stark reminder of the darker side of human behaviour. In a society where kindness is celebrated as a virtue, such acts of violence against helpless animals reflect the urgent need for awareness and stricter laws to protect animal rights. Activists are calling for an investigation into the incident and urging the community to step forward to ensure that such tragedies do not occur again. Animal rights organisations emphasise that humane solutions, such as sterilisation and adoption programmes, are the ethical way to address the challenges posed by stray populations. This incident serves as a wake-up call for all of us to reflect on how we treat the most vulnerable members of our society, be they human or animal. The loss of these innocent lives is a tragedy that should never be repeated. Let us hope that justice is served and that this becomes a turning point in how animals are treated in Bangladesh. If you witness or suspect cruelty to animals, report it immediately to local authorities or animal welfare organisations.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/lifehacks/news/navigating-dhakas-eid-shopping-scene-budget-3576831","Navigating Dhaka's Eid shopping scene on a budget","By now, many have already spent a good chunk of their time shopping for friends and families. After all, can you put a price on the smile of your loved ones after gifting them their Eid dress? However, for people with a limited income, it is a struggle to shop to their heart's desire.  So, I have taken it upon myself to take up a challenge. I set out on a mission: to deck myself out for Eid without breaking the bank or losing my mind in Dhaka's maze of shopping options. My adventure took me from the bustling streets of Elephant Road to the vibrant corners of ODC (opposite Dhaka College), with a few unexpected stops along the way.  First up, the shoes and Elephant Road did not disappoint. Amidst the labyrinth of shops, I found a pair of shoes that screamed luxury but whispered the whopping price of only Tk 2,500. Even after much bickering and bargaining, the salesman did not budge. Given my weakness for shoes, I spent half of my budget not knowing how to complete the rest of the shopping. Walking out of there, I felt like I had flopped the worst bargain in history. If only I had better control! Left with only Tk 2,500 taka, next on my list was the panjabi, an essential Eid attire. Science Lab was my destination, hoping for it to deliver. For Tk 1500 taka, I bagged a panjabi that could easily pass off as aesthetic wear at a good price. The bargaining skill bestowed upon me by Mum has finally paid off. Pairing it with a pyjama from a street vendor for a mere Tk 300, I was starting to feel like a fashion icon on a budget.  My next quest to complete my challenge led me to a street vendor who offered me three shirts for just Tk 600. That's less than the price of a movie ticket at some of Dhaka's high-end cinemas! I, of course, haggled him to lower the price even further but to no avail.  To complete the ensemble, I snagged two pairs of jeans for Tk 400 from ODC. However, there was a slight hiccup. The shirts, in their ambition to make me look more buff than I actually am, were three sizes too large. For Tk 200, a local tailor turned them into bespoke masterpieces. So, there I was, with a complete Eid outfit from head to toe, all within the mythical budget of almost Tk 5,000 (Tk 5,500 to be exact!). Who knew that navigating Dhaka's shopping streets could turn one into a thrift king? Let's be honest, we might not all have the wallet to match our high fashion dreams, especially with the soaring prices but with a little bit of patience, a lot of haggling, and the heart of an explorer, Dhaka offers hidden gems that can make you the star of any Eid gathering.    Photo: K Tanzeel Zaman

The man behind the counter is comrade Yeasin Swapan -- a tea vendor like no other. For his rebellious nature and left-wing political alignment, he has had a reasonable number of adventures and tragedies in his life. Always optimistic and smiling, Swapan makes his tea with love. ""I sell only 300 cups a day and not a cup more. My customers need to be polite and respectful of my ideology and pay first for the tea. I boil 30 litres of milk every day and brew 10 cups with one litre of milk,"" he says. ""Biplobi der Cha"" is Tk 20 a cup where a dollop of brewed frothy, thick milk, a spoon of sugar, and dark black tea, made by steeping the tea leaves, is stirred in. This divine tea is served in paper cups inscribed with the stall's name on it, which is an added attraction. Swapan had a chequered life. He ran away from home for the lack of food and fear of starvation during the devastating famine of 1974 and never returned home to his loved ones till today. From pulling a rickshaw to visiting South America, he has done it all! He spent his wayward youth, visiting Agartala, the capital of the Indian State of Tripura by the day and returning home by night in the mid-70s with his friends. There he met an old man, an expert teamaker, at the bus depot and learned the tricks of making a cup of milk tea, gourmet coffee, buttermilk like ghol or mattha, curds, etc from him, who was almost like his adopted father. Swapan is a well-read man having read memoirs of Che Guevara, the Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, and guerrilla leader, and books by Karl Marx and other writers of that genre. He studied till Grade II only and was later self-taught. He did many odd jobs in life from pulling a rickshaw to being a driver at Transparency International Bangladesh. In his later years, he joined an uncle of his, who was involved in the practice of bringing goods into the country and this business took him to Singapore for assignments.  Following his uncle's ventures, Swapan landed in Peru working in his uncle's new snack bar as a tea barista. His cup of frothy milk tea won many hearts. In his wild hay days, he rode the motorcycle to Brazil, Chile, and other exotic countries, but he fondly remembers his visits to Che's house in Argentina, which is open to the public in the form of a museum, housing a collection of his paraphernalia. Luck was never on his side, however, and following his uncle's death in the late-70s he returned home and had gone through a series of ups and downs. Currently, he has let go of his high-octane adventurous life and is stationed for the moment in making tea at his stall for the last 15 to 17 years. ""I am active in politics and sometimes go to gatherings and talk about my ideology and the life of the underdogs. People always greet me with 'Comrade Lal Salam' or red salute, which is a greeting used by communists in South Asia. They even come to my tea stand to listen to my adventures,"" says Swapan, a lanky man now in his late fifties. So, the next time you are in the vicinity of Shantinagar, look for the comrade who sells tea.","Wed May 31, 2023 12:00 AM         Last update on: Tue Jun 6, 2023 09:53 PM"

The much-anticipated show, Guti, came out on Chorki in January, leaving the viewers binging. There was a photoshoot where the lead characters paid homage to the award-winning show, Breaking Bad, which went viral. The seven-part series gives us insight into Dhaka's drug peddling/smuggling scene of Dhaka and tells the gritting tale of drug smuggler Sultana, played by the versatile actress Azmeri Haque Badhan.  Guti also features Shahriar Nazim Joy, Sharif Siraj, Moushumi Hamid, Nasir Uddin Khan, Arya Aritra, Tuntuni Sobhan, Arfan Mridha Shiblu, and Mahmudul among others.  While the cast certainly played a sizable role in all the praises the show is receiving from its audience, the director's immaculate storytelling abilities really make it stand out. Guti, which was meant to be a film, was deconstructed into several parts to form a web series, and the rest is history. Through his story, Shankha explores the nuances and grey that make up the world of drug smuggling and peddling.  Sultana, the protagonist, finds herself in the heart of a local drug smuggling network which requires one to be ruthless and chaotic. Still, Shankha highlights her warmer and softer side as Sultana is also portrayed as an affectionate mother who wants a better life for her daughter. The series was shot in Dhaka, Cumilla, and Chattogram and is currently streaming in Chorki.  Shankha Dasgupta, the talented director started his journey as a young prodigy in 2007, directing various television dramas and commercials for local and international clients.

He also started his own production house named Filmy Features, which also doubled down as a learning centre for aspiring film professionals around this time. Shankha then went on to direct the telefilm Taxi in 2014 and a commercial for Doze internet under this banner. He is also the co-founder of One Minute Film.  Guti, which was initially supposed to be a short film which, eventually could not materialise due to the pandemic.

Drinking a sufficient amount of water during summer can be challenging; therefore, it is important to adopt beneficial habits that help us stay hydrated throughout the season. Here are some expert-backed ways to navigate summer with ease, ensuring optimal hydration during this period: It is advised to pre-hydrate before starting your day rather than waiting until the evening to catch up on water intake. A few days before the peak of summer, adjusting your drinking habits can also help you cope better with the heat. Drinking water consistently throughout the day is essential. It's also a good idea to carry a water bottle with you wherever you go. If you're tired of plain water, try flavoured drinks or include foods with high water content—such as watermelon, cucumbers, and citrus fruits. Adding water-rich fruits and vegetables to your meals is highly beneficial. A glass of lemon water with a pinch of salt can be refreshing, or try infusing water with natural flavours like lemon slices, ginger, mint, or cucumber. Ramadan might be over, but don't underestimate the power of dates! They're rich in natural sugars and electrolytes, making them an excellent hydrating snack. Dates also provide a quick energy boost—perfect for sluggish summer afternoons. Use ingredients like coconut water, bananas, spinach, and almonds to create electrolyte-rich beverages that replenish fluids lost through sweating. Watch out for common dehydration triggers such as sugary beverages, salty foods, fried foods, and excessive caffeine. These increase urine output and can lead to excessive thirst and dehydration.   The writer is the Chief Clinical Dietitian and Head of the Dietetics and Nutrition Department at United Hospital.

An audio cassette shop! ""Geetika Recording Centre"", one of the oldest surviving music stores in Dhaka, is located on the first floor of Nurul Haque Market, and stepping inside felt like stepping back in old times. Time may pass, but some echoes never leave. CDs and cassettes remind us of a time when music was not just something we streamed; it was something we collected, felt with our hearts and cherished.  Patuatuli — a place that once echoed with music, rhythm, and voices immortalised on tape — has seen most of its iconic shops fade away. Yet, Geetika Recording Centre stands as one of the last survivors of that golden era. The shop was started in the '70s by Santosh Kumar Roy, a soft-spoken man with a deep passion for music. Back then, he was a first-year university student who would often wander into cassette shops. One of his friends' brothers owned a shop there, and Roy would spend hours at the music store. Eventually, he started his own shop, and while many others closed down, his legacy still lives on. ""Back in those days, when you needed a shirt, you had to go to New Market, but if you wanted to record a song or buy one, you had to come to Patuatuli. Every musician of that time had walked through these lanes,"" Santosh Kumar Roy recalls. According to him, the 1990s were the peak! Crowds would flood the area, so crowded that they even had to turn people away. ""Those days are now memories. We barely get customers now,"" he sighs. Roy shows me a vinyl record by the legendary playback singer and actress Suraiya Jamaal Sheikh, known as Suraiya, who was a superstar in the late 1940s and early 1950s. ""I still have this masterpiece,"" he says, handing over a record titled 'Best of Suraiya.' His vinyl collection includes records that are even older. He also proudly displays a collection of records by Mohammed Rafi, one of the most influential singers of the subcontinent. Roy shares, ""Music is food for the brain. Even the busiest soul needs a few moments to breathe; that's when you need music to calm yourself and feel alive again. Today, music is so easily accessible, and it's great! But it has made this generation impatient. Back when gramophones were used, you could only play two songs at a time. So, you had to truly engage with the music and feel the emotions deeply."" From floor to ceiling, the shop is filled with cassette players, DVDs, CDs, and even old audio recorders. It might look like a small shop, but it's more like a museum of lost melodies. I ask, ""Do people still buy these things?"" Roy smiles, ""You'd be surprised. Many people around my age or older still prefer records and cassette players over YouTube. They say the sound feels raw, and the emotion more real."" I met Showkat, who has been working there for 26 years, carefully restoring an old wedding video from a CD. The customer sat beside him, guiding him through the scenes — it was his own wedding video at risk of being lost. That customer turns out to be Prembabu, a Bengali film actor known for playing 'fighter' roles in the 1980s. He was also searching for CDs of the movies Daagi and Usilaa, in which he once played roles; films that are now nearly impossible to find. Another visitor, Abdul Hannan Munna, an elderly music lover, came in with a handwritten list of songs. He still listens to songs on cassettes. ""There's something about the sound,"" he says. ""You just don't get that feeling from modern devices."" The shop gets a mix of visitors: collectors, researchers, students, and people looking to transfer old cassette recordings onto memory cards, or vice versa. Some come just to relive memories, while others come to save them. Prices for cassettes and CDs usually start from Tk 500 and can go up to Tk 1500 or more, according to Md Jabed, another long-time employee who has been working at the shop for about 24 years. Roy passionately talks about music from the 1960s to the 1990s. ""The '60s were the golden era, when legendary singers like Abdul Alim and Abbasuddin Ahmed shaped our music. There was a time when their songs were heard in every household. At weddings, the bride's side only cared about one thing: a good speaker to play the music!"" he explains. As I left Geetika Recording Centre, I paused at the stairs. Isn't that all we need sometimes — a rewind button, playing a song we've forgotten, visiting a place where time stands still, or trying to hold the past a little closer? I look back and hear the shop gently whispering, ""Some things are too beautiful to be forgotten, no?""","Wed May 14, 2025 03:03 PM         Last update on: Wed May 14, 2025 07:46 PM"

This small, cube-shaped sweetmeat, with light sugar coatings and soft chhana inside, have been winning hearts for nearly 200 years. Its long history and unique taste make it a treasure of the district. The oldest shop in the area, Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar, located at Mahadev Potti, has been making chhanamukhi for almost 180 years. The story begins with Mahadev Panre, the founder of this famous sweet. He moved from Kashi to Kolkata with his brother, Durga Prasad. There, he began working in his brother's sweet shop and quickly became popular. After his brother's death, Mahadev moved to Brahmanbaria in search of work, where he found shelter at Shibram Modak's sweet shop. When Mahadev arrived, the fame of the shop grew. Before his passing, Shibram passed the shop to Mahadev. As a Brahman who never married, Mahadev later gave the shop to a nearby temple before his death. Today, four generations later, the shop is managed by Narayan Modak, continuing the legacy. The shop's recipe for chhanamukhi has stayed the same throughout the years. It is made with the same care and attention as it was in the beginning. This consistency has helped Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar retain its reputation as one of the best sweet shops in Brahmanbaria. The shop is surrounded by other confectioneries, many of which are run by the owner's relatives or close acquaintances. While chhanamukhi is the star of the show, Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar is also known for other specialities including taaler bora, roshmalai, jafran bhog, rajbhog, and ledikeni — a sweet with its own rich history, though it is no longer available. Sujit Madan, an employee working at the shop for 25 years, shares, ""Chhanamukhi is the best seller here. Our taaler bora and roshmalai are also fan favourites."" Gopal Sarkar, the skilled moira (the community known for making sweets) who has also been with the shop for 25 years, explains the process of making Chhanamukhi. He explained that the journey starts with fresh milk collected from village farmers. ""To make chhana, we boil pure milk, and about half an hour later, the curdled milk is separated, placed in a cloth, and tightly tied up to remove excess water. Once the chhana hardens, we cut it into pieces and dip them in sugar syrup,"" Sarkar explains. One kilogram of chhanamukhi costs Tk 700, which reflects the purity and effort involved. Sarkar adds, ""It takes 20 kilograms of milk to produce just 3 kilograms of chhana, which is why the price is high, but what you get is pure as a result."" Mahadev Mishtanno Bhandar is a busy shop, operating from 7 AM to midnight. Despite many shops in the area, this shop continues to stand out as the birthplace of chhanamukhi. Simple yet rich in flavour, it continues to be a timeless favourite, enjoyed by generations. A visit to this iconic shop is a must for anyone wanting to explore the region. An interesting fact about chhanamukhi is that it has received Geographical Indication (GI) status in 2024, which means it is officially recognised as a special item from the region of Brahmanbaria.","Mon May 12, 2025 10:19 PM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 10:29 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/relationships-family/news/how-unresolved-childhood-trauma-haunts-marriages-3893176","How unresolved childhood trauma haunts marriages","As adults, most of us follow a typical roadmap from birth onwards. We utter the first word, learn to walk, get into school, graduate, be part of the workforce, and ultimately get married. For many, however, the great promise of happily ever after begins to carry an invisible inheritance. A tightly packed luggage of childhood traumas awaits to get abruptly unpacked through arguments, fights, or silence. With the perpetual focus of being the best version of ourselves, we often bury or ignore the turmoil we face as children. The fissures of the past discreetly seep into the fabric of marriages, where family is valued and cultural expectations are high. They can tighten with each passing year, until something eventually resurfaces. A child's mental map of the world is shaped by the emotional pain they have been through, like seeing parents fight, being abandoned, being treated unfairly, or being verbally neglected. Individuals often view the world through the lens of their ""core beliefs,"" which stem from the nature of the childhood disciplinary process, be it proper or improper. For them, the mental map, which was meant to help them deal with the unstable nature of their first relationships, shapes how they later understand love, trust, and loyalty. This mental map does not just go away when they become an adult. They come back slowly but surely, trying to fit the complicated nature of marriage into patterns set up decades ago, often when the mind was too young to fully understand the world. The initial stages of marriage are often perceived as a period of optimism by couples. A honeymoon period; the culmination of dreams, plans, and endless conversations, during which it appears feasible to build a future that is untainted by the past. However, untreated old wounds slowly but surely return. A partner speaking to their colleague may spark disproportionate anxiety. Over time, this conveys to some that their partner has stopped choosing them. That childhood fear of being left behind comes back without knocking. A minor disagreement over dinner plans could suddenly escalate into a defensive argument. What to others may seem like trivial misunderstandings, to someone carrying unresolved childhood trauma, feels like the terrifying possibility of rejection, abandonment, or loss of identity all over again. Dr Abdul Hamid, a noted psychotherapist at the MONOBIKASH Foundation, explains this phenomenon through the lens of ""mental mapping."" According to him, unresolved trauma quietly steers emotional reactions, often at a subconscious level. ""People try to adjust the new relationship to fit the old mental map created by past experiences,"" he says. The trauma of yesterday finds new battlegrounds in today's marital disagreements, pushing couples into cycles of conflict that feel strangely familiar, yet painfully confusing. The struggle is not always apparent from the outside. In a city such as Dhaka, where societal expectations are significant and the extended family's opinion can frequently intrude on the seclusion of a couple's relationship, acknowledging emotional vulnerability can feel similar to conceding defeat. A significant number of individuals continue to persist, concealing their increasing distance behind the mundane responsibilities of daily life, such as keeping face in front of relatives, doing household chores and paying bills, and taking children to school. Emotional isolation is frequently the result of the mute character of these struggles. Not out of a sense of distrust, but rather out of a desperate, almost infantile need for reassurance, one partner may demand access to the other's social media passwords and phones to achieve hyper-transparency. Mouni, a boutique owner, shares her dismay, ""I never asked for much from Ali (husband), we were getting by and were quite comfortable until his new job came in between us. He became different, and I felt like I was no longer his top priority. We fought on repeat. I had to assert my right over him as his wife. The day I gave him an ultimatum is the day we separated."" After their separation, Mouni sought professional help for depression. ""It shatters me to admit that I harbour severe abandonment issues. The way I clung to the paranoia, the need to be everything to him, all of it traced back to that moment my mother left. I was still that child, only older, louder, and more desperate. I tried to hold Ali close to me as much as I could; my childhood-induced insecurities drove him away,"" she orates. The other partner, who is oblivious to the invisible wounds they are handling, may withdraw, perceiving these behaviours as controlling or suffocating. Dr Hamid points out, ""control, transparency, or hyper-visibility in the relationship becomes proof of love"" for those battling insecurity rooted in early life abandonment or neglect. What begins as a plea for closeness turns into a war zone with locked phones, cold stares, and long nights where both partners sleep inches away but worlds apart. In Bangladeshi society, trauma faced as an adolescent is far from rare. The sources are many — financial instability, natural disasters, gender-based discrimination, and the entrenched patriarchal norms that colour so many family dynamics. Many children grow up internalising the idea that their needs are secondary, their voices are insignificant, or worse, that their very existence is a burden. These emotional scars, if left untreated, mature quietly alongside the individual, only to surface with ferocity when the person tries to build intimacy in adulthood. Such ingrained beliefs can lead to a persistent fear of abandonment or a compulsion to seek validation in adult relationships. This is especially clear in those who observed parental disputes during their formative years. In certain instances, parents may express sentiments such as, ""I would have left already if we did not have children,"" or ""I sacrificed my career to care for our child"" during arguments. Although not meant to hurt, such statements can leave deep scars. These words often get hardwired into the child's emotional memory. To a child's ears, it doesn't sound like love. It sounds like blame wrapped in affection; a quiet reminder that they are the reason for someone else's loss. The child, unable to comprehend the complexities of adult relationships, often assumes blame, leading to deep-seated guilt and a distorted sense of self-worth. Dr Hamid explains, ""They begin to believe that they are the root cause of their parents' suffering and sacrifice. They obsessively try to understand the reason behind the conflict, and every time, they conclude that they're to blame."" Monsura, a service holder, shares her struggles, ""I've always been left behind. It can happen again. The emotional toll of facing that is agonising to say the least. It's like the moment someone stops seeing eye to eye on anything, texting back on time or forgets I exist in a room. I feel this unbearable weight in my chest. I panic."" She convinces herself that her partner does not care anymore; that she's not enough. ""So, I walk away first. It is better to walk away before I get hurt. I've done it three times now. Marriage, to me, has always felt like a test I'm doomed to fail, probably because my father never stayed long enough to validate my affection and efforts towards him or teach me what love without conditions looks like,"" she avows. This is where the fear of ""being lost"" or benign abandonment begins. Individuals start to lose their own sense of self-worth and identity. Over time, this perception becomes their reality. This unresolved trauma may resurface in romantic relationships later in life. They may experience an intense dread of abandonment or a strong desire to exert control over the relationship. Beneath their behaviour lies a wounded child, still terrified of being the reason someone leaves. Bangladeshi women, often subject to body shaming, colourism, and stricter social expectations, face a different set of emotional hurdles than men, who are socially conditioned to suppress vulnerability under the pretence of strength, and be the provider to their family, even if it means putting their lives on the line. This suppression becomes fertile ground for emotional unavailability in marriage — a wall that neither partner knows quite how to tear down. Software Engineer, Reza has always been dubbed as a stoic individual. Despite his nature, he struggles to maintain communication or show affection to his spouse. ""Showing affection or being emotional in general was never my strong suit. This trait of mine came in handy in many instances in life, but never in relationships."" He expresses further, ""It was ingrained by the adults around me, showing emotions was a way of exposing myself. If I cried, I was called soft. If I reacted with anger, I was labelled violent. When I asked for a hug from my mother, I was yelled at for being too clingy."" Expressing his emotions, the skill itself was made to be faded by Reza himself. ""I struggle now, even to show affection to my wife, whom I really love. But she believes that I do not care for her. I am incapable of being emotionally available. I find it difficult to empathise with someone who is experiencing pain."" ""I expect them to do what I do: walk it off or bury it deep down until it does not bother me. I never fathomed that something so natural, like loving or being caring, could be so daunting and elusive. I don't know how to show or express it, but I really do love my wife."" Yet, the irony remains: while the world outside celebrates marital milestones with glossy photographs and cheerful captions, many couples suffer quietly behind closed doors, tangled in past hurts they have never had the space to name, let alone heal. The communication gap widens not just through arguments but in silence as well — missed glances, unspoken resentments, affectionate advances withheld not out of hate but hesitation and in between, life moves on like a play where both actors forgot their lines but keep performing anyway. In a society where mental health is still often seen as a luxury concern, seeking therapy becomes a radical act of self-preservation. But the stigma remains stubborn. Vulnerability is misunderstood as weakness: therapy is often dismissed as unnecessary indulgence. Dr Abdul Hamid stresses that real progress begins when couples stop seeing each other as enemies and start seeing the real adversary — the unresolved wounds both are carrying. Healing involves learning to speak differently, not with accusations but with curiosity, not with defences but with honesty. Sometimes, it means recognising that the tears and anger in front of you are not truly about the missed anniversary dinner or the harsh word in the heat of a fight, but about a scared inner child asking not to be abandoned again. Dhaka, with its ever-shifting skyline and slow, but steady cultural evolution, marriages, too, are evolving. The old ways of bottling everything inside, enduring rather than understanding, are being questioned. Couples are beginning to realise that love alone is not enough if the soil it's planted in remains wounded and parched. There is no single cure, no easy checklist. The journey of healing marital relationships affected by childhood trauma is messy, nonlinear, and deeply personal. It demands honesty not just with a partner, but with oneself. It asks each person to mourn the childhood they deserved but never had and to relearn, with a loved one, how to trust, be safe, and be seen fully, scars and all. Because in the end, marriage is not just the meeting of two lives. It is often the meeting of two pasts. And until those pasts are acknowledged and embraced, the future remains hostage to ghosts that refuse to rest.   **Names used in this article are aliases to keep the identities of the subjects hidden.

As temperatures rise, fashion leans into comfort without wanting to let go of elegance. This summer, style is less about making a loud statement and more about thoughtful choices with lighter fabrics, cleaner cuts, and a softer, more personal way of standing out. Whether it is the easy flow of kameez and saree, or the relaxed charm of a panjabi, summer 2025 is about pieces that breathe, move, and quietly command attention. The classic kameez remains a summer staple, but it's the structure and fabric that adds style to it. Think shorter hemlines paired with flared pants, sleeveless or loose full-sleeve designs, and breezy cottons that hold shape but feel weightless. While neutral tones set a safe base, careful pops of embroidery, block prints, and abstract geometric patterns add to the structured look -- a perfect combination for office and outings. Nothing says Bengali perfection like a saree. However, summer demands a certain looseness in how we approach it. Lightweight weaves like muslin, cotton silk, and khadi are the go-to choices. Sarees in solid colours like ivory, lemon yellow, and pale peach look striking and serene when styled with contrasting blouses or even a crisp crop shirt for a modern spin. Handloom textures and patchwork remain at the heart of the trend with subtle borders or embroidered motifs. This season is not about heavy embellishments; it's about breathing life into tradition with lighter, airier versions that can move from daywear to dinner with just a change of accessories. For men, the summer panjabi steps firmly into the spotlight. Gone are the overly formal versions reserved for festivals. Instead, light cottons, linens, and mixed fabrics in soft tones set the tone for everyday wear. Very minimal chikankari work or subtle thread detailing is enough to make a panjabi stand out without feeling weighed down. Paired with slim-fit pyjama trousers, shalwars, or even denims, the look is polished but easy-going. Summer dressing this year is not about how much you can add, but how much you can refine. Accessories are kept to a minimum; a pair of statement silver earrings or a delicate chain around the neck. Sandals or ballet flats complete the look without competing for attention. This summer, with the heat challenging every step of the way, you must give yourself permission to breathe. Choose pieces that make you feel like yourself, even when the sun weighs heavy. Whether you opt for kameez, kurti, saree, shirt or panjabi, make sure your statement speaks softly but clearly. Less noise, more nuance. And always, a quiet kind of cool.   Model: Parinaz

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dhakas-birds-are-disappearing-should-we-be-worried-3893146","Dhaka's birds are disappearing — should we be worried?","A poetic yet urgent call to action, the documentary, ""Dhakar Pakhi: Chhoto Hoye Ahschey Akash,"" chronicles the quiet disappearance of birdlife in Dhaka — revealing not just what we are losing from our skies, but what we risk forgetting within ourselves. For about 15 months, filmmaker Asker Ibne Firoz (Rusho) has been in pursuit of filming a documentary that will showcase bird displacement to the people of our country. The documentary, currently being shot is hoping to depict in moving detail the fragile lives of birds in Dhaka. Firoz points out that things are changing fast in Dhaka. The wetlands, grassy patches, and quiet groves that once provided sanctuary for hundreds of bird species are now being wiped away due to urbanisation. ""If you look back at 20 years, the same grassy areas are not here anymore. Places like Purbachal, Rupganj, and other areas outside Dhaka still have some greenery, but that, too, is fading. If we don't act now, in 20 years, they'll look just like Dhaka,"" voiced Firoz, with concern. That is a chilling prediction, however, the story is not just about birds. It is also about us. This becomes a tale about what we stand to lose along the way, and how distant we have become from our own environment. Hardly anybody knows that more than 200 bird species call Dhaka home. So, the question begs, should we not be a little more aware of our environment? After all, every animal plays an equally important role in balancing nature. Wildlife is not only about beauty, but also about mutual survival. Yet, we seem to forget that. Firoz questioned, ""The several species of birds in and around Dhaka are one of our most underrated natural resources. But, how can we possibly protect that which we don't even know exists?"" The documentary is aimed at opening the hearts and minds of the general people, especially the children of tomorrow. This is because the future relies on what they choose to do with the knowledge of the documentary – will they protect the birds or forget them? ""In human films, there are roles, timetables, structure,"" Asker Ibne Firoz explains. ""But here, nature writes the story. You might wait three to four days just for a single moment. You might sit in rain, heat, and complete silence, just for a glimpse that might change your perception of things."" A memorable scene was when the crew, drenched and huddled in raincoats, filmed a mother bird feeding its chick, which was struggling due to the rain. ""The baby bird needed warmth from food to survive. We watched as the mother tried again and again, in the downpour. That's the kind of love and instinct you can't script."" Firoz recalls. Ultimately, there is no pinning down or moralising in this documentary. Rather, there is an invitation instilled with passion. An invitation to see, to feel, and, finally, to do. In an evolving world, this film offers an opportunity to step back for a rare moment. The documentary is due to be released in February 2026. Photos: Asker Ibne Feroz

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/maheen-khan-revives-bangladeshi-heritage-silk-elegance-3893141","Maheen Khan revives Bangladeshi heritage with silk elegance ","Coinciding with the Bengali New Year, the Baishakhi Festival exhibition at Bay's Edge Gallery in Dhaka celebrated the rich cultural and artisanal heritage of Bangladesh. Curated by renowned designer Maheen Khan, the event showcased a stunning collection of handwoven silk garments, including saris, jackets, and embroidered quilts (nakshi katha). Sponsored by Hyundai, UCB, and Berger, this exhibition highlighted the country's vibrant craft traditions and their relevance to new age fashion. Maheen Khan's journey into the world of artisanal craft and design began early. ""I started right after college at 21, in 1986,"" she shared. ""For nearly 16 years, I worked in a more institutional setting, focusing on product development. That experience helped me understand grassroots craftsmanship and appreciate the incredible skill of local artisans who have preserved our cultural heritage across generations."" She explained that Bangladesh's traditional arts — needlework, weaving, embroidery — are deeply ingrained in its history, shaped by centuries of cultural influences from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and colonial powers such as England and Europe. Her collaborations with handloom weavers from regions like Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj played an important role in her understanding of traditional techniques. ""Our handwoven silk is very durable, strong, and tactile,"" she said. ""When designing heirloom-quality products, the fabric must be of exceptional quality—resilient enough to last for generations."" Through her collections, she aims to balance respect for tradition with modern tastes. Over the past two and a half years, she has developed a collection of silk sarees inspired by Bangladesh's diverse history, integrating traditional motifs with contemporary design elements. Maheen Khan's collections are heavily inspired by Bangladesh's layered cultural influences, including Islamic geometric patterns, Arabesque motifs, and indigenous Bengali designs. ""Bangladesh's history is a melting pot — Dutch, Portuguese, English, and local Sultanate influences have all shaped our aesthetic,"" she explained. ""Despite its small size, our country's art and craft carry the weight of a thousand years of cultural synthesis."" She stresses that traditional craft is not just art — it is a livelihood. Many artisans rely on needlework and textile arts as their primary income, making their support crucial. In Jamalpur, she works directly with artisans, training and upskilling them to ensure that their craftsmanship remains relevant and sustainable. ""We aim to create slow fashion — garments crafted with patience, designed to be treasured and passed down,"" she said. ""Colour choice is key. I love ivory because it's timeless and versatile. For summer, we select pastels that evoke serenity and freshness; for winter, jewel tones like deep reds and emerald greens. Every decision is thoughtful, from the fabrics to the motifs."" Her inspiration from traditional Bengali designs like shitol pati, terracotta patterns, and woven geometric motifs is evident in her work. Maheen Khan also explained that every piece in her collection tells a story. ""It's a journey from the raw yarn to the finished garment,"" she said. ""Every stage bears human touch — done by hand — making each item unique. I carefully curate the details, from embroidery to finishing."" She credits her collaboration with master curators like Shaibal Shaha for maintaining the authenticity of her work, trusting his spontaneous judgment to bring her vision to life. Looking forward, Maheen Khan's primary goal is to elevate Bangladesh's textile and craft industry globally. ""We need more support and investment. Our traditional crafts are sustainable, slow, and rooted in culture. The world is increasingly focused on sustainability, and our artisanal practices fit perfectly with that movement,"" she said. ""By showcasing our heritage, we can build a valuable niche on the international stage."" Beyond commercial aspirations, Maheen Khan emphasises cultural pride. ""Our heritage isn't static,"" she said. ""It's a living, evolving story. I want our craft to be recognised worldwide, not just as traditional art but as a modern, sustainable industry that empowers local artisans and preserves our identity."" She believes that with more exposure, investment, and strategic partnerships, Bangladesh can shift from being primarily known for readymade garments to being celebrated globally for its handcrafted textiles, too. Her vision extends beyond individual collections. She aims to foster a global appreciation for Bangladesh's artisanal wealth and to ensure artisans receive fair recognition and support. ""Supporting local artisans isn't just good business — it's a moral obligation,"" she asserted. ""When artisans succeed, they become ambassadors of our culture, and their work helps us preserve our heritage while creating meaningful economic change.""   Photo: Courtesy

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/transform-your-dining-space-eid-arrives-3893126","Transform your dining space before Eid arrives! ","Eid-ul-Adha is just around the corner, and while many of us are busy checking off the usual to-do list: finalising the Qurbani budget, stocking up on essentials, and revisiting those cherished family recipes, there are certain important details that often get overlooked until the last minute, like decorating the dining space. This is, after all, the heart of Eid gatherings — the place where dishes are served and memories are made. So, this year, why not give it the attention it deserves and make it truly festive? Start now, and your future self will thank you! Why? Because the curtains will smell like flowers instead of dust, the tablecloth will not feature that suspicious stain, and your fancy cutlery will actually sparkle, rather than giving off accidental ""vintage"" vibes. Knock out these low-key chores first: declutter the cabinets, wash your curtains, polish any wood surfaces, and give the rarely seen tableware its moment. These little changes will make the entire space feel fresh and festive, without denting your wallet. And don't forget the lighting. It plays a surprisingly big role in setting the mood. Swap out harsh overhead lights for softer alternatives. Floor lanterns, fairy lights, or a cluster of candles as a centrepiece can change the atmosphere entirely! For good! Pair this with a few indoor plants in the corners for a touch of nature. These small changes not only highlight your food beautifully, but also create a cosy, inviting environment. Now, let's focus on the dining table itself. The literal centrepiece of your dining room. If you have been contemplating an upgrade or addition, Eid preps might be the perfect excuse to explore options. Love a clean, modern vibe? There are minimalist designs that champion ""less is more"" —like Scandinavian-style rectangular tables with light wood finishes or sleek tempered glass tops that bring an airy, elegant feel to your space. They are not just beautiful — they are practical, especially for smaller dining rooms. But, if you are looking for something with a bit more presence, an ornate table in dark wood or marble can add a touch of luxury and bring a classic, refined feel to your room. They are perfect if you love entertaining or want your dining space to feel a little grand. You may consider adding a sofa or couch in the corner if you have more space. Though space is rare, especially in a city like Dhaka. So, if making room is your major concern, consider extendable tables that grow when guests arrive. Some contemporary sets even include built-in storage, which is perfect for maintaining space. Round tables, on the other hand, foster style, intimacy, and conversation. You can go for them as well. However, if you are concerned about the budget, you do not have to compromise — the furniture brand Hatil is offering 5-10 per cent discounts. They also offer EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) plans, so you can upgrade your space without paying everything upfront. It's a good way to invest in quality while keeping your budget in check. So, if you have been eyeing that gorgeous table, now is your time to go for it before Eid!","Mon May 12, 2025 09:29 PM         Last update on: Mon May 12, 2025 09:37 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/health-fitness/news/perimenopause-and-menopause-understanding-the-hormonal-journey-3892236","Perimenopause and menopause: Understanding the hormonal journey ","Menopause is not a singular event. It is part of a broader continuum of change that begins years before the final menstrual period and continues long after. Understanding this passage, beginning with perimenopause, can turn confusion into clarity, and fear into empowerment. Across Bangladesh and much of the world, women often enter the perimenopausal stage of life with little awareness and even less preparation. Conversations around it are scarce, cloaked in discomfort and cultural silence. Yet this transition — a complex hormonal and emotional shift — touches nearly every aspect of a woman's life, from her physical wellbeing to her psychological stability and sense of identity. ""My sleep was a mess, I kept forgetting things, and my heart would race for no reason. For months, I thought I had an anxiety disorder or early dementia. It never crossed my mind that it could be perimenopause"" Menopause doesn't arrive all at once. Dr Syeda Husna Akhter, Senior Consultant Gynaecology and Obstetrics at Super Specialized Hospital, Dhaka, explains, ""There's a transitional stage called the climacteric. It includes perimenopause, the early shift, and post-menopause, which follows after periods have permanently stopped."" Perimenopause typically begins in a woman's early to mid-40s, though some experience symptoms earlier. It can last anywhere from a few months to over a decade. During this time, oestrogen, the hormone responsible for regulating the menstrual cycle, mood, and reproductive health, fluctuates unpredictably. This hormonal imbalance affects the brain, heart, bones, and even digestion. ""You might have irregular periods, or go two or three months without one, and then suddenly get two in a single month,"" says Dr Akhter. ""The ovaries begin to reduce their hormone response, but not all at once. That's why the symptoms can be so erratic."" ""I was snapping at my children for no reason, crying during meetings, and waking up at 3 AM every night. I thought I was just burned out."" Many women initially misattribute their experiences, describing it as a period of ""emotional short-circuiting."" In truth, they are going through a biological transformation that affects every woman, yet is rarely explained well. The range of symptoms can be broad and deeply personal. From sudden heat in the face and chest — hot flashes — to insomnia, depression, vaginal dryness, brain fog, digestive trouble, and loss of libido, the body starts to send signals that many find hard to interpret. ""Hot flashes are a hallmark symptom,"" says Dr Akhter. ""They usually last two to three minutes and cause the face and upper body to flush. For some women, they're barely noticeable; for others, they disrupt sleep and work. Stress and lifestyle factors can worsen them."" Psychological symptoms are just as common. Mood swings, irritability, or even unexplained grief can descend without warning. Hormones regulate the reproductive system and the brain. As oestrogen drops, women can feel mentally unbalanced, like they're not themselves anymore. ""I thought pregnancies cannot happen if periods are months apart"" One common misconception is that once periods become irregular, fertility ends, but that's not necessarily true. A largely unspoken aspect of this life stage is its impact on intimacy and sexual health. Vaginal dryness, discomfort during intercourse, and reduced desire are all common but rarely addressed. ""After oestrogen declines, the vaginal lining thins and loses elasticity,"" explains Dr Akhter. ""This can cause painful sex, urinary discomfort, or even cystitis. Many women suffer in silence because they don't know this is connected to menopause."" Dr Akhter encourages women to speak up and seek help. ""These are natural changes, and they can be managed – either through lifestyle, topical treatments, or in certain cases, hormone therapy."" In Bangladesh, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed conservatively due to potential side effects. ""We try to start with non-medical solutions,"" says Dr Akhter. ""Good sleep, regular exercise, a calcium-rich diet, and emotional support go a long way."" She adds, ""If symptoms become unmanageable — severe insomnia, mood crashes, unbearable hot flashes — we do consider HRT but only in minimal doses and with close monitoring. Side effects like breast tenderness, irregular bleeding, or reduced breast firmness can occur."" ""I would cry in the shower and then walk into the office like nothing happened. I didn't even know it was hormonal"" For those without access to specialists, the first line of treatment is often understanding and reassurance. ""The role of psychological support is huge,"" says Dr Akhter. ""Sometimes, women just need to hear that what they're experiencing is normal and that it will pass."" Despite its inevitability, menopause remains a topic shrouded in discomfort. In South Asian households, where women's identities are still tied closely to reproductive roles, this transition is viewed as a loss rather than an evolution. ""Menopause doesn't mean a woman's value has ended,"" says Dr Akhter firmly. ""It's a time for reflection, for shifting priorities, and embracing maturity with strength."" Hossain puts it best: ""I thought menopause would mean life slowing down. But instead, it gave me clarity. I stopped worrying about monthly cycles and started focusing on myself. I only wish I had known more about what to expect."" Perimenopause and menopause are not medical tragedies; rather, they are deeply human transitions. With education, support, and agency, women can reclaim this stage not as a decline, but as a redefining of their lives. ""Menopause is not a disease,"" Dr Akhter emphasises. ""It's a phase. With the right tools — physical, emotional, and social — women can move through it with dignity."" In a country like Bangladesh, where health conversations are still layered with stigma, breaking the silence around menopause is not just necessary — it's liberating. Because every woman deserves to understand her body, and every woman deserves to feel whole, even as she changes.","Sun May 11, 2025 07:33 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 07:39 PM"

These fresh juice recipes bring together the earthy sweetness of fruits, the sharp kick of ginger and chilli, and the timeless tang of citrus. Whether it's the smoky charm of pora aamer sharbat or the subtle elegance of watermelon juice laced with honey and sea salt, each recipe here celebrates the art of cooling down! Ingredients
 8 cups watermelon cut into 2-inch cubes 1 tsp raw honey ½ tsp kosher or sea salt 1-2 sprigs of fresh herbs, such as mint or basil (optional) Method Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and set aside. Place watermelon, honey and salt in a blender. Blend on high until no chunks remain. Depending on the size of your blender, you may need to do this in two batches. Pour into the strainer and press the pulp with a wooden spoon to extract all of the juice. Pour the juice into a container with a tight-fitting lid. Chill. When ready to serve, shake vigorously (because it tends to separate) and serve with a sprig of herbs, if using. Ingredients 
 4 raw mangoes ¼ cup fresh mint ½ roasted cumin powder ¼ tsp roasted dry red chilli powder 1 cup sugar 2 tsp black salt 6 cup water Method Wash and dry the raw mangoes. Using a fork, prick it all over. Roast the mangoes over direct heat for about 10 minutes. Peel the skin and let it cool. Using your hands pull out all the pulp. Take the pulp in a blender. Add sugar, black salt, roasted cumin powder, roasted red chilli powder, mint and blend to make a paste. Add water and blend again. Refrigerate for about 2 hours. Pour the glasses and serve chilled. Ingredients
 4 carrots 2 apples 2 tbsp honey/sugar (to taste) ¾ cup to 1 cup water Method Scrub carrots well and wash them; peel off the skins if needed. Peel off 2 apples and chop them into small slices. Chop the carrot into small cubes. Take it in a blender, add water little by little and puree it smoothly. Now strain this through a fine strainer, you can strain this using a clean cloth. Blend the apples separately; strain. Now add honey and apple juice to the carrot juice and mix well. Chill this for an hour. Serve cold. Ingredients
 1 large piece of fresh ginger (about 3-4 inches) 4-5 lemons (freshly juiced) 2-3 tbsp honey or sweetener of choice (adjust to taste) Ice cubes (optional) Method Peel the fresh ginger root and cut it into small pieces. Grate the ginger with a little bit of water to create a smooth paste. Place the grated ginger in a fine sieve or cheesecloth, and press or squeeze it to extract the juice. You should have around 2-3 tablespoons of fresh ginger juice. Squeeze the juice from the lemons and strain it to remove seeds or pulp. In a large pitcher, combine the freshly squeezed lemon juice, ginger juice, and cold water. Stir well to mix. Add honey (or your preferred sweetener) to taste. Stir until it's dissolved completely. If you want a tangy flavour, feel free to adjust the amount of sweetener. Pour the ginger lemonade into glasses filled with ice cubes (optional). Ingredients
 5 cups diced watermelon ¾ cup raspberries 2 cups coconut water ¼ cup lime juice 2 tsp sugar Handful of mint leaves Method Firstly, dice up a watermelon to attain 5 cups of it. Blend this to get a fine juice and then strain this through a fine mesh sieve. Get rid of all the seeds and fruit pulp so that you are left with thin and translucent watermelon juice.   Next, cut raspberries into halves and puree them in a blender. After getting a fine puree, pass this through a sieve to get rid of all the seeds and solid substances. Add in 2 teaspoons of sugar to this and mix well. Squeeze a couple of limes and remove their seeds to get a 1/4 cup of lime juice.  Combine all these prepared ingredients together in a blender along with 2 cups of coconut water. Pulse them for a few seconds until you get a clear and homogenous mixture. You can adjust the level of sweetness by adding more sugar according to your taste preference. Lastly, chill this in the refrigerator and garnish with a sprig of mint before serving to add a pop of colour and a burst of freshness. This tastes best when served cold.","Sun May 11, 2025 07:25 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 07:32 PM"

Within 21 months of restarting the much-anticipated service, Biman yesterday announced the suspension of operations on this route, effective from July 1. The national flag carrier said the decision was based on three factors: the ongoing hajj operations, shortage of aircraft in its fleet, and financial viability of the route. However, insiders said the airline was compelled to take the decision as it has been incurring heavy losses since resuming the service. Officials told The Daily Star that Biman has so far incurred losses of over Tk 84 crore on the route, averaging around Tk 4 crore per month. Biman had first launched flights on the Dhaka-Narita route in 1979. After a temporary suspension in 1981, the service was resumed, but it was again suspended in 2006 due to continuous losses. Seventeen years later, on September 1, 2023, the route was reopened without a proper assessment of its commercial viability. Since then, the relevant departments at Biman have reviewed passenger numbers, revenue, and operational costs. Several officials, seeking anonymity, said the key figures behind the resumption of the Narita flight were then managing director Shafiul Azim and then acting director (sales and marketing) Salauddin Ahmed. At the time, tensions were ongoing between the then Sheikh Hasina government and the United States. Biman's fleet primarily relies on Boeing aircraft, manufactured in the US. During that period, European aircraft manufacturer Airbus offered to sell planes to Biman. Salman F Rahman, who is now behind bars and was then the PM's adviser, reportedly supported the Airbus proposal. In this context, Biman launched flights to destinations such as Narita, Rome, and Toronto, without assessing commercial viability, in what officials said was an attempt to justify the purchase of new aircraft. The move was promoted as an achievement of the then Sheikh Hasina government. Biman operates the Narita route with Boeing 787-800 aircraft, which have 271 seats. Insiders said nearly half the seats remained vacant on most flights. Data from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport shows that Biman is the only carrier offering direct flights between Dhaka and Narita. Eight other airlines operate connecting flights on the route via third countries. Asked about the suspension, Biman spokesperson ABM Raoshan Kabir said the airline had been incurring losses on the route. ""Biman suspended operating this flight due to poor cabin factor,"" said Raoshan, who is also general manager (public relations) of Biman. In aviation, cabin factor or load factor is a key metric that reflects how efficiently an airline fills available seats on its flights. Contacted last night, Shafiul Azim, who was made secretary to the Election Commission while serving as Biman MD and CEO in May 2024 and is now an OSD, said the allegation of not assessing financial viability was baseless. ""We had further plans centring the Narita flight. We had plans to go to Los Angeles and Vancouver through code-sharing agreements with All Nippon and Canadian airlines,"" he said. In aviation, code-sharing is an arrangement where one airline sells seats on a flight operated by another carrier under its own flight number and code, allowing airlines to expand their route networks. ""We resumed the Narita flight with the approval of the then Biman Board,"" he added.","Mon May 19, 2025 12:06 AM         Last update on: Mon May 19, 2025 08:46 AM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/who-needs-gold-costume-jewellery-the-real-treasure-3897391","Why costume jewellery is dominating Bangladeshi fashion","It mirrors our heritage and cultural identity, and pairing it thoughtfully with an ensemble reflects our personal flair for styling. Women who effortlessly think outside the box — who know how to play with fabrics, colours, and accessories — are flamboyant fashionistas without question. Costume jewellery only add to that appeal. Made of sterling silver, alloys, nickel silver or German silver, copper, zinc and nickel —jewellery are all in fashion now high. Costume jewellery add a touch of extravagance to the muted bling look. Pairing ethnic or antique traditional ornaments with the right attire adds not only charm but also a chic edge, elevating any look to stand out. Such styling is now a favourite practice of fashion-conscious young adults and chic mature women.  Today, women are also appreciating the in-trend contemporary, delicate, fuss-free ornaments. Classy women, with a panache for style, are embracing both the old and new. Modern and contemporary styling is all about pairing old-style with cutting-edge fashion and ethnic or traditional jewellery amps up your style quotient. The design of traditional jewellery has evolved over time, especially in detailing like adding intricate designs in multiple layers or using large gemstones. Jewellery is classified into three distinct categories: trinkets or costume jewellery, semi-fine, and fine jewellery. Costume jewellery capitalises on a specific, fleeting trend with the use of non-precious stones, Swarovski crystals, rhinestones, and affordable metals and alloys. Semi-fine jewellery is gold-plated, or gold-filled like sterling silver, and uses affordable stones like topaz, opal, garnet, etc. They have a shelf life and will also stand the test of time like fine jewellery. The glitz, glam, and all things precious like solid gold, pure silver, platinum, with precious gems make the world of fine jewellery. The intricate designs of jewellery from different countries spin a historical narrative of the place it originated from. The complexity of designs and workmanship of Bangladeshi, Indian, Afghan, Pakistani, Pashtun, Iranian, Ottoman, and Rajput jewellery are starkly different from one another. They vary in terms of design arrangement, the use of gemstones (both precious and semi-precious), the inlay work or minakari, the addition of chipped stones, and in other techniques. Ornaments in Nepal, for instance, are characterised by the extensive use of turquoise, while Rajput ornaments speak of opulence and splendour. Afghan jewellery, especially Kuchi jewellery, has colourful glass insets and metal. The famous chokers with glass inlays and dangles are a must-have item in your Afghan jewellery collection. Strings of semi-precious stones, pendants, amulets of lapis lazuli, emerald, tourmaline, kunzite, and agate must be part of your jewellery collection. These pieces of jewellery, from the ethnic groups of Nepal, Rajasthan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, which drew inspiration from ornaments worn by nomadic women of these places, are all a collector's item and come with a price tag. What makes costume jewellery special is the ability to tell a story. Whether it's through vintage finds, handcrafted tribal pieces, or bold contemporary designs inspired by cultural motifs — the ornaments are not just accessories but wearable art forms that celebrate individuality and artistic expression. Whether layered over a handloom saree or paired with a minimalist outfit, they effortlessly transition from casual daywear to statement evening looks, proving that elegance does not always have to come with a hefty price tag. Jewellery of any kind is a good investment, traditional or modern, tribal or semi-precious, is not the point in question. Rather appreciating the heritage, art, and craftsmanship, and the modernity in jewellery designs speaks volumes about your elegance and good taste.   Model: Shababa Rashid, Farzana Hoque

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/it-doesnt-rain-shukhno-gram-3897386","It doesn’t rain in Shukhno Gram ","In a forgotten railway station where the rain never falls, a solitary station master's routine is upended by an unexpected visitor in blue. It's a quiet tale of chance, connection, and longing as the romantic story unfolds. When studying economics back in DU, I never imagined that I would end up working at an old, rundown railway station in a desolate, remote village. But here I was: a station master in charge of possibly the least active railway stop in the country. It is called Shukhno Gram Rail Station, named after the village, although the locals call it Hoogna Geram. Why shukno, hoogna, or dry? Because it does not rain around here! Now in my mid-30s, I have been posted at this station for almost a decade — and not a raindrop in my career. My job has its perks, of course. No corporate politics, no Excel sheets; just minor interactions, basic record-keeping, etc. But no exciting stories either. I have become as dry as this village. On a warm May afternoon, a train stopped at my station. I frowned. The first and last train of the day had left several hours ago. A train would stop now only if someone pulled the emergency handle. A minute later — a grunt, followed by a heavy luggage being tossed out, followed by a woman in a blue saree. ""Excuse me! How can I go to Dhaka from here?"" the lady in blue asked, rubbing off beads of sweat below her nose while the train disappeared. I was dumbfounded. There was no easy answer to her question. She had to take muddy roads, trawlers, and local buses to get to the nearest city. After I explained all that, she yearned, ""When is the next train?"" ""Tomorrow noon,"" I replied helplessly. Then, after dragging the luggage to the waiting room, she fell on one of the benches, shut her eyes, and began to rest. I now closely studied this strange woman. The rojonigondha on the wrist contrasted with her dusky skin. The aalta on her palms and fingers gave a festive vibe. Large but not too flamboyant jewellery glistened in the sunlight that poured into the waiting room through large windows. The meticulously draped blue saree hid most of her sweat-drenched black blouse. ""Never seen a beautiful woman before?"" she sleepily taunted, with her eyes still closed! She woke up with a shudder. After recovering and remembering her whereabouts, she let out a sigh. ""Why are you here?"" I eventually addressed the elephant in the room. It was now dark outside. The station was even more desolate at night. The temperature was much cooler, at least by our Hoogna Geram standards, which is a relief, given that electricity is almost always out. Taking a sip from the cup of tea that I offered, she replied flatly, ""I ran."" ""Eloped?"" ""Ran away from my wedding that is taking place in two days,"" she continued. ""I came as far as I could and got down at this random station. This is so childish. I will go back tomorrow."" I looked at her helplessly. ""And why are you here?"" now she asked me back. ""What do you mean, why I'm here? I am the station master."" She slowly got up from the bench and took a seat beside me. ""No, really, why are you here? You seem to be a nice, talented man wasting and rotting his life away in this place."" I had not been confronted with this question in a long time! Graduating from economics, while my friends frantically applied for corporate jobs or started their own businesses, I walked around the campus aimlessly. You see, I always wanted to be an artist. But instead of Charukala, I chose economics, doing what I thought would be the right thing to do. My desire to paint never went away. And so, after I was done with studies, I couldn't help but paint and travel, leaving economics forever. That was how I discovered this place. I settled here because there was no one to bug me, and I was in love with the beauty of the village — the blazing krishnachura blooms, the muddy pathways, crystal-clear skies, and quiet and stillness. ""I want to see your art,"" she told me after hearing all this. I showed her some sketches — a large banyan tree just outside the station, trains arriving and departing, my guard dog Bhulu and his pals who made this station their home, a colleague and friend who worked in another shift, the baul who often visits me for a chat, but most of all, harrowing scenes of droughts of the Shukhno Gram.   She was moved, touched, and shocked to know that it never rains here. Then, she playfully declared, ""If it rains before my train comes, I will not return to Dhaka and stay here!"" ""Ok Google, will it rain today?"" — I asked my phone, to which Google remained silent. Network issues! She chuckled, leaning against a wall. ""You won't get so lucky!"" Warm rays of the morning sun shot at her face, so much so that she couldn't keep her eyes open properly. But she held her pose — leaned on the wall sideways — as I busily dipped my paintbrush on the palette and focused on the canvas in front of me. I painted furiously: locks of hair, large earrings, blue saree, olive-toned skin, white petals, red aalta. ""You didn't tell me last night why you eloped,"" I continued. ""Does it matter? Aren't you glad that I did?"" I let it go. She told me many things yesterday — her job in a management consultancy and how much she hated it, her friends and family who by now must be really worried about her, and how much she loved this saree that belonged to her mum and decided to wear it at the pre-wedding party that she eventually escaped from. But she didn't tell me why she escaped. By the time I laid down my paintbrush, it was almost time for the train to arrive.  She stared at the canvas in awe. ""Do you really find me so beautiful? You keep it. Put it in a gallery one day and invite me to your exhibition when you become a famous artist!"" I brought her luggage to the platform. ""No rain,"" I sighed. ""No rain, sorry!"" she reiterated and laughed. ""Go home and sleep. I wanna be alone for a while. Your shift has ended a long time ago anyway."" ""So, is the wedding back on?"" She turned pensive, paused, and announced again, ""It didn't rain."" Shukhno Gram Rail Station became smaller and smaller as I looked on while sitting at the back of a rickshaw-van. When the building got rather tiny, I heard a rumble — a thunder! Rahim Miah braked. ""Station master, what is happening?"" A cold breeze. Grey clouds. A lightning. Another thunder! ""Take me back to the station! Hurry!"" The villagers were out on the meadows and fields. Children ran out of their school. Farmers looked at the sky in disbelief. Energy and anticipation swept through. But it doesn't rain in Shukhno Gram, remember? It may show some false hope once or twice a year, only to break people's hearts again and again. The grey clouds soon subsided, and the skies were clear. This village is cursed. By the time I rushed back to the station, it was like any other day -- hot, humid, dry. The short-lived hope of a downpour was gone, and so was the train. I turned back wearily to go home.  Suddenly, someone called out, ""Excuse me! I think I missed a train."" I know this voice. I turned around again. There she was — all smiles — my bride in blue!   Model: Shababa Rashid

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/rise-and-resist-self-defence-workshop-dhaka-university-3895511","Rise and resist: Self-defence workshop at Dhaka University","On Saturday, 10 May 2025, students gathered at the central gymnasium of the University of Dhaka for a self-defence workshop titled ""Rise and Resist."" Organised in collaboration with Legacy MMA Gym, the event brought together around 120 individuals to learn basic self-defence techniques to respond to harassment or physical assault. In recent times when students are facing increased safety-related anxiety, the need for self-protection feels relevant and essential. The idea was not to turn anyone into a black belt overnight, but to plant a seed of resistance. Shehreen Amin Bhuiyan, Assistant Proctor, lecturer, and Chairperson of the gymnasium, said, ""While we're doing everything we can to prevent unsafe situations, we wanted to think beyond just security guards and CCTVs. What else could we do for our girls? Something to build their capacity, their instinct to protect themselves, not just on campus but outside too."" Legacy MMA, which has previously worked with many universities, handled the session in a way that felt suitable. They did not try to overwhelm the students with heavy techniques. Rather, they broke it down step by step, starting from basics. And more importantly, they focused on what happens in our heads during those panic-fuelled moments when instincts freeze. The session began with that psychological groundwork before moving on to light warm-ups and stretching, which eventually led to self-defence techniques based on mixed martial arts at the end. It was not just about learning kicks and punches being thrown, it was about figuring out how not to freeze when things go wrong. When you have been told your whole life to stay quiet, keep your head down, and not make a scene, learning how to stand your ground is more than physical. One student, Maliha, reflected on this layered experience, ""We really enjoyed the session. But more than that, we need more of these. This isn't just about knowing how to defend ourselves. It's about feeling confident, like we're not helpless. It empowers us."" The truth is, no number of workshops can single-handedly fix what is broken. Not until the larger structures, social, cultural, and institutional, finally catch up and start treating safety and dignity as non-negotiable. In the meantime, small revolutions matter. And, so the name ""Rise and Resist"" felt especially apt. Not just because it sounds catchy on a poster, but because it captured a simple truth, rising and resisting are not grand gestures. Sometimes, they begin quietly, in a campus gym, with a stretch, a breath, and a newfound sense of control.   Photo: Courtesy

For the elderly, however, this is rarely sufficient. Their bodies could have difficulties adjusting to heat, and in more grave cases, present serious health hazards. If you are worried about protecting your elderly loved ones from the scorching heat that is sweeping over the country, take the necessary steps towards better health now. Keeping a towel in the fridge might work wonders. When placed over the shoulders or legs, it cools the skin gently and safely without leaving the person feeling jarringly chilled by ice or freezing packs. In fact, cooling is not just about AC or fans. Wet cloths can be applied to the different pulse points around the body including the neck, wrists, or behind the knees to help with reducing core body temperature. While full showers sound like heaven in summer, sponge baths with lukewarm water and a soft cloth works best for the elderly. It soaks their body gently, and is especially important for those having heart or blood-pressure issues since abrupt changes in temperature can be harmful. Another simple yet effective thing would be to keep soothing products in the fridge. This could be anything from lotions, to misting sprays, to even small pillowcases. Its cold application can provide relief from skin irritation produced by heat. In particular cases, elderly people can use mist sprays over their arms, legs, or face when they feel that they are suffering from itchy skin in the heat. Through evaporation, this is a good cooling option and pairs well with a fan. At times, medications are also known to influence elderly people with increased sensitivity to heat. This is because some medicines may interfere with water retention or heat regulation, raising the temperature sensitivity of an individual. If you are concerned regarding this, have a doctor or pharmacist go through all prescriptions and see what adjustments could be made to the medication on days of extreme heat. During heatwaves, one should not underestimate the need for breathable feet. Coax your elders into wearing sandals or perhaps a soft slipper around the house to keep their feet from overheating. That being said, avoid rubber or plastic on hot floors, as they actually trap heat and add to general discomfort. Last but not the least, focus on food for elders' hydration. Heavy, warm meals tend to increase the core temperature of the body. So, water-rich fruits such as watermelon and cucumber are the way to go, along with light alternatives such as smoothies.","Thu May 15, 2025 04:18 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 04:22 PM"

They show up like New Year's resolutions: full of grand declarations but barely making it past February. You've seen them. Heard them. Probably muted them on social media. Wrapped in oversized hoodies while sipping overpriced hot chocolate, they post things like, ""I miss the warmth of summer,"" or ""I just want to feel the sun again."" Well, guess what? Summer is here. And Dhaka — this summer isn't just hot — it's being cooked. Not metaphorically, not poetically — literally. With temperatures steadily hitting 38-40°C and humidity smacking you in the face, stepping out at 3 PM now feels like entering a malfunctioning sauna that charges you extra even for breathing. Office-goers look like they've run marathons, and schoolchildren resemble survivors of some science experiment involving lava. The air no longer moves — it hovers. And the sun? It doesn't shine. It taunts, harasses, and assaults. Less ""Hello, sunshine"" and more ""Kneel before me, mortals"" kind of attitude these days. The dust sticks. The sweat stings. The overhead fans are basically decorative at this point. And the biggest betrayal of all? Power cuts. In 2025. During heatwaves. Let that sink in — though nothing sinks anymore except morale. And this is practically the new normal. Some days feel like 46°C in Dhaka, unless a moody cloud gets emotional and decides to cry over Mohammadpur. Basically, the city has transformed into a full-fledged urban heat island — thanks to our unholy alliance with carbon emissions and concrete jungles. Even the crows — nature's most shameless noisemakers — have fallen ominously silent in this heat. You know it's hot when the crows go quiet. Interestingly enough, another species has gone quiet — the one I was talking about in the first place. Yes, the Summer Sentimentalists. Remember them? The sun-craving poets of January? They've vanished faster than a Wi-Fi signal during load-shedding. No more sun-drenched Instagram stories with Coldplay in the background. No more tweets romanticising the smell of sunscreen and mangoes. These once-vocal admirers of vitamin D have gone radio silent — probably lying face-down in air-conditioned rooms, regretting every word they ever said about ""missing summer."" To track the current activity of this curious species, we conducted a quick lifestyle census (we cornered some sweaty pedestrians). It revealed the new migration map of the former summer enthusiasts! We found that a large group of them are now air-conditioned mall hoppers, suspiciously lingering in shopping centres — not buying, just breathing. Another group has turned into amphibians, living in buckets or under showers. They now prefer water to emotions. Still, there are some flat-out denialists. ""It's not that bad,"" claims Ismot, who prefers not to go out because he might faint in this heat. Now the question is, dear denialists, if you truly love summer, why are you hiding behind your double-glazed windows and quietly deleting those ""I love summer"" Instagram posts from 2019? Go out. Bathe in the sun. Show your love for the season — if you dare! Meanwhile, the brave few — the delivery riders, street vendors, and rickshaw pullers — are carrying the city on their sunburnt shoulders. Let's be honest, they are the true summer warriors. So, if you're still claiming you're a summer person, it's time to prove it. Go out, touch some sunlight, and take a walk from Farmgate to Shahbagh at 1 PM. Then come back and tell us how romantic the heat felt on your third-degree tan. Because this isn't Tuscany. This is Tejgaon in May. And no, we don't want to see you reposting some reel with ""Summer breeze makes me feel fine…"" while sitting next to a table fan the size of a UFO. Sure, we still have mangoes, sugarcane juice, and the occasional unexpected evening rain that feels like nature's apology letter. But let's be real — the season has changed. Summer in Dhaka is no longer a mood. It's apocalyptic! So, to all the summer lovers out there: Either come out and own it, or stop posting mango-filtered lies. We see your thermostat! It's set to ""Antarctica,"" and we're not fooled!","Thu May 15, 2025 04:13 PM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 04:18 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/lifehacks/news/surviving-bangladeshs-heatwave-ac-free-solutions-3895301","Surviving Bangladesh's heatwave: AC-Free solutions","As a heatwave sweeps across the country, many of us feel exhausted and restless all day. To combat the fatigue, it is not enough to stay indoors only — we also need to make sure the environment inside is cool and refreshing. While air conditioning is our go-to solution, we often tend to forget about the high-power usage, affordability issues, and technical difficulties. To tackle the harsh sun this year, here are a few alternative cooling techniques you can follow to stay energised throughout the day, without depending on an AC. More often than not, a cluttered room can obstruct natural air flow, causing the room to trap heat. To regulate the indoor temperature, keeping your room clean and minimal can play a crucial role. Get rid of bulky furniture, heavy textiles and fabrics so that air can travel inside your room smoothly. Remove items with heat-retaining materials like wool or velvet. Make sure to keep your flooring free of thick rugs — it will naturally feel cooler underfoot. Think of rearranging your furniture in a way that ensures lots of open space, as it ensures breezes to distribute cool air evenly throughout the room. One of the most cost-effective ways to block the heat in your room is to place a wet sheet, preferably cotton-made light-coloured fabric by the window. As warm air from outside flows through the moist fabric, it draws heat out of the air, cooling it before it enters your room. This age-old technique works like a natural air-conditioner! Make sure to rewet the sheet every couple of hours to continue the cooling effect. Placing a bowl of ice, frozen water bottles, or an ice pack in front of your portable fan can drastically cool down the room. In case you are using a ceiling fan only, keep a bucket full of ice or cold water in the room to achieve the same results. During the peak heat hours, this process can offer instant relief from the sweltering heat. This method is somewhat energy-efficient, and a quick and practical way to create a cool zone in any room. Did you know lighting has a strong impact on indoor temperatures? Traditional incandescent and halogen bulbs emit a significant amount of heat — making the surroundings feel uncomfortable. To avoid that, opt for energy-efficient LED bulbs, which not only consume less electricity, but also emit very little heat in comparison. If you are open to investing a little for a more effective cooling solution, a dehumidifier can be a smart choice. These devices work by eliminating excess moisture from the air, which in turn, helps maintain a cool environment. As a heatwave makes humidity levels reach higher, your skin feels sticky even if you are indoors. Keeping humidity under control can make sure you have a fresh atmosphere in the room, leaving you feeling comfortable. To make your home a little cosier and cooler in summer, make sure of proper cross ventilation in the room, so that fresh air can pass through the room without difficulty. If your room is situated on the west side where the heat gets harsher, opt for dark and double-layered curtains to reduce heat gain into your room.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/who-needs-gucci-weve-got-gamcha-couture-3895296","Priota Iftekhar: Flying the flag through fashion","It's fashion as storytelling, and the storyteller is Priota Iftekhar. Once known as the ""Flag Girl"" for proudly waving our red-and-green flag across borders, she is now catching attention with her refreshingly bold, cultural attires in Sydney, Australia. Priota Iftekhar first rose to fame by fearlessly travelling solo with the Bangladeshi flag in her hands. It was a powerful act that broke stereotypes and sparked a movement rooted in identity, freedom, and national pride. She is also the founder of an online community, The Flag Girl. ""When I travel abroad, people often don't realise I'm Bangladeshi,"" says Iftekhar with a smile. ""Many have never even heard of Bangladesh and assume I'm from India. And that's exactly why I decided to come up with things that somehow represent who I am and where I come from."" Priota Ifetkhar started The Flag Girl project in 2009 and it allows people to stay connected around the world. People from more than 50 countries are members of this network, mostly young people. Her global influence was later acknowledged in 2018 when she won the title of Miss Culture Worldwide. And now, she is continuing her path as the director of Bangladesh Tourism Beauty, an organisation that is empowering women and showcasing Bangladeshi culture to the world. Now based in Australia, Iftekhar's expression of cultural identity has taken on a new form, particularly through fashion. Her most recent photoshoot, full of bold colours, familiar symbols, and street-style nostalgia is a magnificent homage to Bangladesh. In one unforgettable look, Iftekhar wears a tailored blazer made from gamcha — a humble, chequered cotton fabric used across Bangladesh. The piece of textile was actually sourced from Dhaka's New Market and transformed into a high-fashion statement. The accessories told just as much of a story: earrings shaped like tiny jhalmuri cones (the streetside, spicy, Bangladeshi puffed rice snack), fuchka-inspired earrings, and even a handbag styled to look like a double-decker BRTC bus. All these quirky, joyful pieces were crafted by the creative minds at ""Sketch & Handmade Craft — Art Gallery"". The shoot also featured international model Valeria Busch, who wore a striking dress designed by Media Ahmed Dipa, with the bold message ""Banglar mayera meyera shokolei muktijodhdha"" meaning, Bengali mothers and daughters are all freedom fighters. She also carried a matching box bag designed by Sharollo, with the same fierce sentiment. Outfits designed by Shagufta Shahid Etrat under Mezro Agency were showcased in the photoshoot, which was not just about fashion but a celebration of identity, memory, and pride. As a certified personal stylist and model, Iftekhar has found her own way to make a statement. Whether she's walking the runway or styling a look, she carries her roots with pride. ""In everything I wear and do, I try to showcase my culture,"" she explains. Currently, she is preparing for the upcoming Australian Fashion Week and her goal is clear. She's planning to wear a saree that captures the essence of Bangladesh, something unmistakably hers and undeniably homegrown. ""People here genuinely appreciate our culture,"" she says. ""And I never want to miss a single opportunity to represent it with pride."" This purpose is not just a word in Priota Iftekhar's life; it's a part of her upbringing. Growing up, she was surrounded by stories of boldness and vision. Her grandmother, Nurjahan Begum, did not just write history, she made it as the trailblazing editor of Begum magazine, a powerful voice for women at a time when few dared to speak up. Her grandfather, a journalist at The Daily Ittefaq, believed deeply in nurturing young minds through the ""Kochi Kachar Mela"". With his camera, he captured the soul of a nation during the Liberation War and carried those images to the world — telling Bangladesh's story when it mattered the most. That legacy of courage and creativity shaped Iftekhar as a person. She became the first in her family to earn not just one, but two master's degrees — one from the prestigious University of Technology Sydney. However, degrees were only the beginning. She now brings her passion to life as the PR and Communications Manager at JICS Australia, where she leads multicultural initiatives that celebrate diversity, inclusion, and identity. What sets Priota apart is not just her résumé — it's her presence. Whether she's speaking on a panel, walking the runway, or simply strolling through Sydney, there's something magnetic about her. She carries her heritage not as a burden, but as a badge of honour. Imagine walking down a street in Sydney and seeing a girl carrying a handbag that resembles a packet of crackers — the same one you used to munch on during school breaks. And then you notice her earrings: tiny plates of fuchka, so perfectly detailed that it seems like they came straight from a street stall in Dhaka. For a moment, you might feel that you're not in Sydney anymore. You're back home! And just when you think it can't get more nostalgic, you realise she's wearing a bold blazer, which is made from the same cotton that's used to make a traditional Bangladeshi gamcha. Sounds surreal? Perhaps, but it's real and Priota Iftekhar is making it happen.   Photo: Courtesy

Originally designed to accommodate 8 million passengers annually, the airport handled nearly 12.5 million passengers, both domestic and international, in 2024, compared to 11.7 million in 2023, according to the outgoing executive director of HSIA, Group Captain Kamrul Islam. He was speaking at an event organised by the Aviation and Tourism Journalists' Forum of Bangladesh at the Civil Aviation Authority headquarters in the capital. The incoming Executive Director of HSIA, Group Captain SM Ragib Samad, was also present at the event. Despite political volatility last year, passenger traffic through HSIA rose by around 8 percent, primarily driven by the continued outbound flow of migrant workers. Authorities expect the situation to improve once the much-anticipated third terminal becomes operational by the end of this year. With the terminal, the airport will be able to handle more than 20 million passengers annually, leading to smoother operations and improved services. The added capacity will also allow more airlines to operate flights from Dhaka. Kamrul also highlighted that introducing accountability-based operations significantly improved passenger services at the country's busiest airport. ""We focused on ensuring accountability during my tenure. As a result, over 85 percent of baggage is now delivered to passengers within the standard time, monitored through automated tracking systems,"" he said. Kamrul projected that the aviation sector's contribution to Bangladesh's GDP could reach 5–6 percent within the next five years, up from less than 1 percent at present. Newly appointed Executive Director Group Captain Samad pledged to prioritise international-standard services for both passengers and cargo, with transparency and professionalism. ""An airport is the first impression of a country. It must reflect the highest standards,"" he said. The programme was presided over by ATJFB President Tanzim Anwar, while General Secretary Baten Biplob moderated the event.","Thu May 15, 2025 12:08 AM         Last update on: Thu May 15, 2025 04:38 PM"

Drinking a sufficient amount of water during summer can be challenging; therefore, it is important to adopt beneficial habits that help us stay hydrated throughout the season. Here are some expert-backed ways to navigate summer with ease, ensuring optimal hydration during this period: It is advised to pre-hydrate before starting your day rather than waiting until the evening to catch up on water intake. A few days before the peak of summer, adjusting your drinking habits can also help you cope better with the heat. Drinking water consistently throughout the day is essential. It's also a good idea to carry a water bottle with you wherever you go. If you're tired of plain water, try flavoured drinks or include foods with high water content—such as watermelon, cucumbers, and citrus fruits. Adding water-rich fruits and vegetables to your meals is highly beneficial. A glass of lemon water with a pinch of salt can be refreshing, or try infusing water with natural flavours like lemon slices, ginger, mint, or cucumber. Ramadan might be over, but don't underestimate the power of dates! They're rich in natural sugars and electrolytes, making them an excellent hydrating snack. Dates also provide a quick energy boost—perfect for sluggish summer afternoons. Use ingredients like coconut water, bananas, spinach, and almonds to create electrolyte-rich beverages that replenish fluids lost through sweating. Watch out for common dehydration triggers such as sugary beverages, salty foods, fried foods, and excessive caffeine. These increase urine output and can lead to excessive thirst and dehydration.   The writer is the Chief Clinical Dietitian and Head of the Dietetics and Nutrition Department at United Hospital.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dilnawaz-dance-drama-where-love-transcends-the-mortal-veil-3892216","Dilnawaz: A dance drama where love transcends the mortal veil","Drawing from Sufi philosophy and fusing classical and contemporary dance traditions, Dilnawaz offers not just a spectacle, but an experience of the soul's deepest longings. Produced by Shadhona and directed by Lubna Marium, this performance revives a forgotten fable from Urdu literature, bringing to life the story of a slave girl, whose journey through love leads her to spiritual transcendence. Drawn from the lost but resurrected short story by Rahat Ara Begum, a writer whose pen was once silenced by political divide. The production charts the inner odyssey of a handmaiden in a royal court. Dilnawaz, the humble slave girl, traverses the perilous terrain of longing and surrender, her love for an oblivious prince becoming her gateway to spiritual transcendence. Her journey, told in seven movements that echo the seven stages of Sufi love, is anything but servile. Attraction (hub), Infatuation (uns), Love (ishq), Trust (akidat), Worship (ibadat), Madness (junoon), and finally, Annihilation (fana) — each stage strips away another layer of self, until only pure essence remains. Through a deft fusion of the Mugham dance traditions, Indian classical Kathak, and the sinuous rhythms of contemporary jazz, the dance drama embodies the universal yearning for union; not merely with the beloved, but with the Divine. It is no accident that Rahat Ara Begum — herself a practicing Sufi in 1940s Kolkata — wove this mystical thread into her only foray into mythic storytelling. And it is fitting that her granddaughter, Lubna Marium, would spend ten patient years nurturing this vision, culminating in six intense months of rehearsal to bring Dilnawaz to the stage. ""Not a dry eye in the hall,"" Marium recalls, but she stood firm for the story, and demanded nothing less than total devotion. Mubasshira Kamal Era, who embodies Dilnawaz, delivers a performance that goes beyond dance; it becomes ritual. Her portrayal captures heartbreak and ecstasy in equal measure, her body a vessel for emotions that words cannot contain. ""For a whole 10 minutes, I just spun,"" she says. ""I was in a trance. The claps, the awe in the audience, I could feel them, though they didn't reach me. My body was just in a trance, something I felt from within."" That moment, a solitary figure spinning, lost in divine madness, became the production's heartbeat. Era's own journey adds another layer of poignance: once driven away from dance by bullying, she returned years later to stand before an audience of over 700, everyone on their feet, caught in collective rapture. Dilnawaz is not content with mere narration. It communicates, blending classical rigor with contemporary freedom, weaving South Asian and Middle Eastern traditions into a single fabric. Each movement, each gesture, is charged with the sacred duty of conveying the ineffable. It is this alchemy that has left audiences spellbound and hearts unguarded. As Lubna Marium puts it, ""Performance transcends the world through art. With Dilnawaz, we present a story of love, devotion, and mysticism, weaving together South Asian and Middle Eastern performance traditions."" At a time when art is often reduced to entertainment, Dilnawaz reclaims the stage as sacred space. It reminds us that love, in its truest, most transformative form, is both the path and the destination. Like the Sufi seekers before her, Dilnawaz dances not for applause, but for annihilation. And in doing so, she invites us to shed our own layers, to spin until we too, touch the eternal.   Photo: Courtesy

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/things-your-mother-did-made-no-sense-until-now-3892121","Understanding mothers: A journey through time   ","Its Sunday, 5:30 AM. My mother just woke me up from a nightmare of me in my late 30's, sitting behind a desk and typing, only to deal with a new one; its 1995, and I have to get ready for school! It takes a hot minute before this noggin gets into gear, so I go through the morning ablutions on autopilot. As my last fake-cry for 'stomach ache' gets ignored, and I am being shipped off to school, I think to myself, why my mom was so resolute about that 5:30 AM wakeup call, even though school starts at 8; its 1995, so no crazy 2-hour tailbacks, and our own car was outside waiting. I could have easily gotten up at 7 AM, and still made it just in time for class. ""Well, I know you need your time after waking up. You are slow in the bathroom. And you need to eat because your break is at 11 AM, and I don't want you to stay hungry till then. And if you are late during assembly, you'll get an earful, so I am sparing you that too."" That would be my mother's reasoning, except she never said it out loud. Of course she didn't. She is a brown parent, after all. That, and my mother was more about actions than words. I came to this conclusion in my 30's, a time when you have enough humility to find your own faults, and have a better awareness for your folks. Mothers, you see, are strange creatures. They aren't always master communicators, but they know all of our shortcomings, and shape us in ways we only realise once we become actual adults. And for all our belly-aching, they stand resolute, to the point of coming out as a villain, if you see things with 2025 sensibilities. We will see different phases of our mother as we go through time, and with it, different lessons that will shape us. When we are young, they are stern, almost unaffable. Why? That's the discipline phase, of course. For example, couldn't she have told me this reason growing up? Wouldn't the eight-year-old me get it? Probably not, or worse, take advantage of the weak moment and press the 'stomach ache' get-out-of-school excuse card. So, eight-year-old me probably needed this warden more than I would like to admit. Now, I am in 1997, during summer vacation. My aunt and cousins are over for a visit. I take my cousin (five years younger) out to play 'borof paani' with my other cousins. While running, she falls and scraps her knee. With my aunt busy consoling her, my mother berates me for being irresponsible and letting her get hurt despite explaining she fell because of the uneven street. However, she would hear none of it. She was with me, she was younger than me, and she was hurt. It was a failure of my responsibility as her elder brother. This incident drove into me the lesson that our juniors need us to look out for them. It was also a big lesson in taking responsibility for someone when they are with me. Was there perhaps another way to get this lesson? Perhaps, but not that early in life, and not that resolutely. 1999. We are all at this family function at a relative's place. I was chatting up with another cousin. It was nice. You see, most of my cousins are either much younger than me, or much older than me, so it was nice to talk to someone my age for once! So, me and her sat at the balcony and we talked about life, or at least how life was apparently awful for 12-year-olds, and how we couldn't wait to grow up! My mom came for me twice, asking me to try the kebabs as they were really good. But I was too engrossed talking about wanting to be an adult fast! That, and too many people make me nervous. After an hour or so, by which time, I was sure they ran out of kebabs, my mom suddenly came to me with a wrapped-up tissue bundle; in it were 3 kebabs she saved for me. When a relative caught my mom's eye, she smiled and said, ""This idiot loves kebabs!"" Things my mother would have a hard time winning awards for was expressing her thoughts/emotions truthfully. Why? Well, perhaps they assume our ego would get too big if they adore us, you know, typical brown parent thing. However, she would win every award when it came to actions, because be it holding my hands at the dentist, or turning my head the other way when I was getting an injection because I was, and still am, afraid of needles, just like her, or slipping a few kebabs aside for her dolt son. Back in 2000, Igloo Mega was the new sugary goodness, and everyone was raving on about them. You could say it was trending. School just finished, and there was my mom, waiting at the parent's corner. A friend just described Mega to me, and I had to have it. So, I started pestering my mom then and there. Pestering is a mild term, looking back at it now, as I was basically whinnying loudly non-stop, and tugging her in front of all the other parents. Mom had enough, grabbed my arm, gave me 'The Look' and dragged me to the car. The ride back home was silent, but the moment we stepped foot in the house, she went nuclear. ""Do I not feed you?"" ""Do you not get what you ask for?"" ""You asked once. That was enough!"" All the traditional brown parent handbook's comeback phrases were exhausted. Was there a lesson there? Other than maybe not embarrass her the way I did? Yes of course. With mothers, you never know when you are being schooled. This lesson? Having manners, not creating a scene, listening and not reacting, not to be a whiner, and most importantly, respect. Pretty good lessons to come out of this ice cream memory trip, especially considering, later on, when I got to the try the ice cream, it really didn't live up to the hype. I was studying in Dhanmondi for my O' levels back in 2003-2004. However, when you are 16 or 17, the only mandate is to be 'cool.' How? Play the latest video games, hang out with your friends at 'happening' Pizza Hut, and of course, be in a relationship, because you just transitioned from 'girls… cooties' to 'will you marry me.' And in such a conducive environment as Dhanmondi, you fall in love every 30 seconds, unless of course, your mom follows you everywhere and makes sure you stay in line, and in so doing, kills all hopes of a social life. Why? Just so I score well in O' levels? It would seem, as usual, mothers know beforehand, and best. Despite her monitoring, I did manage to land a girlfriend. However, when it came to that inevitable first heartbreak, you learn that teenagers just can't see past the pain. My mother, one of very little words, only said, fall in love when you get to university. Not like I listened, but what she said had sound logic. Find your one, and settle down. A valuable lesson, in an era, where anything but love is off-limits. This was the start of a softer, more understanding/forgiving side of my mother, for I feel the discipline arc had been complete. In your mid-30s, people left-right-and-centre has only one query; when will you get married? Surely, the 30-somethings reading this now can relate to this one hard, regardless of gender. And what's worse is the emotional manipulation people whip out of their bag of horrors. The men's side of the conversation usually goes like this; ""With your parents getting old, its time you marry someone who can help you take care of them."" Why? Am I not enough to take care of them? Why do I need to bring someone else's daughter to take care of my mom? Seems I have been imprinted without even knowing it. My mother, while being desperately ill, asked if I wanted to get married. I asked whether she wanted me to, to which she replied, ""Why would someone else care for me? Do it when YOU are ready. Don't worry about me. You always took your time, but you did things right. So, do it when you are ready."" Mothers are an important element in any child's development. And for sons, mothers are THE most important element in their development. A son wouldn't always choose to be vulnerable with their father, call it male ego but it is what it is. A mother can break this façade and communicate better, without any retaliation. It wouldn't at all be a stretch to say that a mother shapes their son's moral compass. And not a word of lie when I say nobody will love you the way your mother does. It is also not a stretch to say that your house only becomes a home when your mother is there. For those of you unfortunate enough to know what that means, all I can say is sorry. It has been almost exactly a year since my mother passed away. Since then, like my heart, my empty hallway is a stark reminder of my loss. Where once I could see my mother sitting or lying on her bed from my door and across the hallway, now I see an empty chair and a spot on the bed, and a framed picture of my smiling mother. On Mother's Day, social media is filled with everyone taking selfies with their moms, and to be honest, I always found that 'too tiktok-y and influencer-ish.' While my stance remains the same, I would say take that selfie, and take some more. Because one day, you will yearn to see her, and this will be one way. The other? To see yourself as the person she has shaped you up to be.","Sun May 11, 2025 05:33 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 03:14 PM"

I talk about her aim. Because if you grew up in a South Asian household, you know. You know! The soft rubber slipper, especially the humble, iconic, Bata flip-flop was never just footwear. It was a tool. A symbol. A parenting philosophy with grip soles and unexpected velocity. This Mother's Day, while others post filtered photos and heartfelt captions, I'd like to take a moment to recall the real shaper of destiny and an airborne form of justice: The Flying Slipper™. And if you're a millennial or older, the feels are going to hit hard. But the slipper wasn't about pain, it was about principle. You could lie, sneak out, flunk math, but once that slipper took flight, you had a half-second to reflect on your sins and dive behind the fridge. And sometimes, the slipper followed. This wasn't footwear. This was weaponised parenting. I thought I was special until I started asking around. Tanzina, 31, swears her mom's slipper once curved mid-air and hit her AFTER she ducked. ""Physics still hasn't explained it,"" she says. ""There was no wind, bro."" The slipper wasn't just used, it was precision-launched across living rooms, over furniture, sometimes around corners. And somehow, it always found its target. Like a heat-seeking missile guided by betrayal and unfinished homework. But here's the twist: it didn't even have to hit you. The slipper was 90 per cent psychological warfare. Just seeing it being slowly lifted off the foot was enough to reset your entire moral compass. The slow rise of the arm, the child's eyes widening and the suspense before the launch. Even Spielberg doesn't direct with that kind of buildup. Rubab, new dad and part-time troublemaker who now works in finance, said, ""My mother used to hold the slipper like a grenade with the pin half-out. The message was clear: Don't make me throw this!"" The beauty of the flip-flop is that it wasn't just for discipline. No, no. This was a multi-purpose household gadget. Need to keep a door from closing? Wedge in the slipper. Table leg wobbly? Slipper. Cockroach mocking you cause it can survive a nuclear fallout? Slipper clap. If The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was written in Bangladesh, the most essential item wouldn't be a towel, it'd be a chappal. And the Guide would say: ""Never panic. Unless she's taken off her slipper, then run."" Different cultures have their own take. The Japanese take their shoes off at the door and rely on silence. Americans walk around indoors in sneakers and believe in ""timeouts."" But across the Middle East, Latin America, Eastern Europe and all of Asia, flying footwear is a shared language. The term ""chancla"" in Hispanic cultures refers to the slipper as both a symbol of maternal authority and a source of humour. Slippers are the world's most affordable, low-latency, Bluetooth-free correctional device. The slipper did not just build correction, but also reflexes. Thanks to slipper discipline, my generation (yes, the millennials) can catch falling phones mid-air, duck drone shots at weddings, and sense bad vibes through walls. My friend Jitu has a legendary tale. Early in his wooing phase, his then-girlfriend (now-wife, so you know this ends well) tried to hand him back his phone during a 'he's wrong, she's right' discussion. He refused to take it, she let go. And the phone began its descent… slow, tragic, cinematic. Like Hans Gruber falling off Nakatomi Plaza at the end of Die Hard. But Jitu didn't panic. He coolly stuck out his leg, let the phone bounce off his shin, caught it with his foot like Maradona, and eased it to the ground. No screen cracked. No points lost. A love story saved… guaranteed by slipper reflexes. But let's be real: the flip-flop never really hurt. Not in the long run. It was flexible. It was soft-ish. It was more symbolic than anything. A gentle reminder wrapped in terror. The slipper said, ""You messed up. I love you. But you messed up."" And always, after the chaos, came the calm, the hug, the food. The casual, ""Jao, kheye nao,"" like you hadn't just ducked for your life behind the sofa. I remember once, true story, I tried to run. She waited. Held the slipper. Let me wear myself out like a hunted goat. Then, calmly, she launched it. I tried ducking much like Neo in The Matrix. The slipper hit me just as I thought I was going to dodge this. These days, we joke about it. We see the memes, we laugh at the stand-up sets. But deep down, we all carry the memory of that sound: shlop-shlop-shlop on the gray mosaic floor. The national anthem of Bangla discipline. That's the thing, this wasn't just parenting. It was theatre. There was a rhythm to it. The lecture. The dramatic removal of the slipper. Behind every chappal throw was a woman who was tired, overwhelmed, possibly trying not to let the onions burn on the stove, and still had time to correct your nonsense. So, this Mother's Day, here's to the moms who raised us right. Who never missed a throw. Who didn't always have time for gentle chats, but always had time to make us better, one slipper toss at a time. That slipper, with my shoulder printed on its sole, is long gone. But whenever I pass a Bata store, I stand a little straighter. Because somewhere deep in my muscle memory, I still hear the shlop-shlop, whoosh!","Sun May 11, 2025 04:12 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 03:14 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dear-pet-moms-mothers-day-yours-too-3891311","Dear pet moms, this Mother’s Day is yours too","Every year on Mother's Day, we celebrate moms who raise children with love, care, and dedication. We give them flowers, cards, hugs, and appreciation for all that they do. But what about women who care for furry babies — like cats, dogs, rabbits, or birds? They are pet moms, and they deserve to be seen and celebrated too. Motherhood takes many forms. For pet moms, caring for an animal means offering patience, affection, and a sense of home — just like any other kind of parenthood. A pet mom is someone who treats her animal like a member of the family. She feeds them, cleans after them, takes them to the vet, plays with them, and loves them deeply. Just like human mothers, pet moms worry when their pets are sick, they smile when their pets are happy, and they work hard to give them a good life. For many pet moms, their pets are their kids. They call them their babies, talk to them, and sometimes, even dress them up. Their bond is full of love, care, and emotional support. Taking care of a pet is a big responsibility. It takes time, money, and a lot of heart. Pet moms often make sacrifices — like skipping holidays, staying up late with a sick pet, or adjusting their lives just to make their pets comfortable. You may not be packing school lunches or attending PTA meetings, but you are showing up — every single day — for a living being who depends entirely on you. That's not a phase. That's real parenting. Many pet moms also help rescue animals, adopt strays, or foster pets until they find a forever home. They show kindness not just to their own pets but to animals in need. Isn't that a kind of nurturing spirit worth celebrating? Motherhood wears many faces. Some sing lullabies, others jingle treat bags. No, it's not the same journey — but the love runs just as deep. On Mother's Day, there's room at the table for every kind of mom. In fact, Mother's Day should be about honouring the spirit of motherhood — the nurturing, the sacrifice, and the unconditional love. Whether it's for a child or a cat, a toddler or a turtle, that loving spirit is what we should celebrate. ""It's just a pet,"" some say. But would you say that to someone whose heart breaks as they say goodbye to their lifelong feline friend? To the woman who feeds and shelters strays while no one's watching? To the person who becomes a source of safety for their fearful dog during every thunderstorm? Love is love. Care is care. And motherhood is about giving your whole heart — no matter who's on the receiving end. Mother's Day should be a celebration of love in all its forms — of those who nurture, protect, and show up every day with care. Pet moms may not have diaper bags or school drop-offs, but they carry love in their hearts and fur on their clothes. And that counts, too. So, this Mother's Day, let's widen the circle. Let's raise a toast not just to mothers of children, but to mothers of paws, feathers, and whiskers. Because motherhood isn't defined by biology — it's defined by love.","Sat May 10, 2025 04:30 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 09:22 AM"

But for the animals around us — street dogs, cats, and birds — the summer heat is an invisible predator. It drains their energy, dehydrates their bodies, and in many heartbreaking cases, takes their lives. In Bangladesh, where temperatures can soar well above 40 degrees Celsius in peak summer, small acts of kindness can mean the difference between life and death for these voiceless beings. Let's not wait for a viral video to move us. Let's act now — with empathy, awareness, and above all, kindness. One of the simplest and most effective ways to help is by keeping shallow bowls of clean water outside your home, office, or shop. Terracotta or clay bowls are best because they stay cooler than plastic or metal. Refill them daily, ideally twice a day. Place them in a shady spot where birds, dogs, and cats can safely access them. In Dhaka's densely populated neighbourhoods, even a small veranda or windowsill can become a lifeline for a thirsty bird. Animals don't always have access to trees or cool spaces. Street dogs often curl up on blazing pavements or under parked vehicles, both dangerously hot. If you can, place a jute mat, an old sack, or cardboard in a shaded area for them to lie on. A cardboard box with holes can also become a mini shelter for a kitten or a bird. If you have a balcony, rooftop, or garden, create shaded corners with cloth or tin sheets. Planting trees, of course, is the long-term solution, but providing immediate shade saves lives today. For those who feed street animals, remember that summer demands a diet shift. Heavy or spicy food can dehydrate animals. Instead, opt for simple rice mixed with affordable scraps like chicken feet for dogs, which can be a good source of protein as well. Cats can benefit from fish or meat with a bit of rice and water. Keep the portions light and feed in the early morning or evening to avoid attracting flies and heat spoilage. Heatstroke in animals can be fatal, but is often preventable. Signs include excessive panting, drooling, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, or collapse. If you find an animal suffering from heatstroke, move them to a cool, shaded area immediately. Pour room-temperature (not icy) water on their paws and body. Offer water in small sips. Then call for help. Several organisations in Bangladesh offer animal rescue services. Try calling PAW Foundation, Obhoyaronno, Care for Paws, or your nearest vet. Even if you can't take the animal in, helping it reach safety is a noble act. Birds, too, benefit from soaked grains or fresh fruits like papaya and banana. Avoid feeding bread or biscuits — they're often harmful and not hydrating. In summer, animals often seek refuge under parked cars for shade. Before you start your vehicle or move your bike, please give it a tap or honk to wake up any animal resting beneath. It's a small habit, but it can prevent tragic accidents. Also, try not to scare away animals from shady spots or water sources. In this weather, survival trumps cleanliness. And most importantly, teach children empathy! Encourage them to put out water, pet animals gently, and learn about their needs. Growing up with compassion builds not only kind individuals but also a more humane society. Despite countless articles, campaigns, and social media posts, heartbreaking stories of animal neglect and abuse still surface far too often. It's easy to feel disheartened, thinking one person's efforts can't possibly change the narrative. But kindness is contagious, and when we act together, as a community, our compassion becomes a force that can shift attitudes. So, this summer, let's start small but strong and give the animals around us a fighting chance under the burning sun.","Sat May 10, 2025 04:21 PM         Last update on: Sat May 10, 2025 04:29 PM"

And with about 25,000 restaurants scattered all over the city, it might not be called the city of restaurants, but would it really be a misnomer?  Casual questions aside, quite a number of those restaurants are located on rooftops. And as you might be well aware, DSCC has issued a notice towards all restaurants under its jurisdiction. In a notice published on 28 April, Dhaka South City Corporation has revoked the trade licences of restaurants operating without proper approval. The notice also addressed rooftop restaurants and the issue of public safety. The notice was an instant topic of discussion, especially amongst those who dine out frequently. ""I'm a bit confused by it. I agree with the decision to shut down unsafe buildings and restaurants. But I am not sure what to think about the decision regarding rooftop restaurants. Surely, there are a lot of rooftop restaurants that follow the safety protocols, right?"" asked Amina Shahreen, a Dhanmondi resident who frequently goes out for dinner. ""I love the open space. So, it would be a bummer if they closed down all of them,"" she added. Belal Hossain, a banker from Aftabnagar, also had similar views. ""I'll be honest. I enjoy rooftop restaurants, and if I had a choice, I'd always pick the rooftop restaurant with all other things being equal. There is one near my home and I go there with my wife often. I love how it looks over this open space, and in the distance, you can see the sky as well as this water body. And the open air makes it so much better,"" he recalled his latest rooftop experience. ""For around Tk 1,000, I can get dinner for two and a place to hang out for an hour with this aesthetic surrounding. For me, rooftop restaurants are more appealing because of the aesthetics rather than the food,"" he acknowledged. According to the Bangladesh Restaurant Owners' Association (BROA), restaurants across the country are employing about 30 lakh people, with about two crore people being either directly or indirectly linked to the industry. ""We've had a meeting with DSCC, and we are seeking to reach a solution through mutual understanding,"" said Imran Hassan, Secretary General of Bangladesh Restaurant Owners' Association (BROA). ""The notice was sudden. We had no idea about it whatsoever. Without any prior notice or consultation, it's a blow to the business,"" he added. According to BROA, the restaurant industry is difficult on its own with its requirement of numerous licences and approvals. COVID was a huge blow, and even though it has been a while, the recovery was a challenging one. In addition, the sales fall whenever there are blockades and so on. And getting loans is also a challenge, which can make it difficult to run a business. ""Whether you are an office goer or just out for another reason, thousands and thousands of people dine out every day. So, you can imagine how important this industry is. And there is potential, too. But we really need more support from the authorities,"" emphasised Imran Hassan. Rooftop restaurants have been growing in popularity over the last few years. For many, it's really about spending some quality time under the open sky with the availability of food. DSCC's concern about public safety is no light matter either. Hopefully, the involved authorities and institutions can reach a decision that is safe and beneficial for the public.","Thu May 8, 2025 04:42 PM         Last update on: Thu May 8, 2025 04:50 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/how-tagore-song-became-my-eternal-lullaby-3889826","How a Tagore song became my eternal lullaby","The song was taking its toll on me. I would fall asleep any moment now. The boat was rocking with the flow of the current underneath. Was I dreaming? What is the specific boundary between sleep and wakefulness? The gigantic sky above me was glowing red. Innumerable miles below, frogs were croaking; crickets, ""cricking""; large, ghost-like banyan trees, hissing. I was trying to gulp the rare beauty of a night I seldom encountered: ""Majhe majhe tobo dekha pai, Chirodin keno pai na."" Is it necessary that lullabies – songs sang in order to put babies and young children to sleep – must be those few that are officially treated as lullabies? Ghum Parani Mashi Pishi is of course amazing, and no doubt a ""successful"" lullaby indeed, but if you think of it, any song that is very soft and soothing and rhythmic can be a lullaby. I had my share of the traditional lullabies. I loved them. But strangely, my favourite lullaby is a Tagore song. My first encounter with Rabindranath was on a boat during a monsoon many years ago. Being one of the earliest memories, I remember it in bits and pieces, which have been enough to conclude that it was one of the most magical nights of my life. My head rested on my mother's shoulder. We were in Bikrampur, my village-home; my family was on its way to our ancestral home from a dinner at a relative's house. How do you travel at a village during the rainy season? The most obvious mode of transport is a boat. My mother started to sing Majhe Majhe Tobo Dekha Pai to put me to sleep. Pitch darkness. The only sources of light were the kerosene lamps on the boats and hand torches to guide the way. But the sky was lit red. Being just a five-year-old child, I was so taken aback, so surprised by this strange phenomenon. Meanwhile, a storm was brewing. But I was nevertheless half-asleep. My eyes were now half-closed. In some strange way, I could still hear my mother's overwhelmingly reassuring and comforting voice:
 ""Keno megh ashe hridoyo akashe, Tomare dekhite dae na, Moho meghete tomare dekhite dey na, Moho meghete tomare... Ondho kore rakhe, Tomare dekhite dey na"" Perhaps due to that night, the meaning of this song to me, quite naively, is totally different and a little bit absurd. It makes me visualise the massive clouds tugged together, the redness of a cloudy sky in a monsoon night and an elusive moon that is hard to find behind the clouds, only allowing a short glimpse every once in a while. However, when it comes to lullabies, I think the tone does the trick more than the lyrics. In fact, it has been said that it is the love of the parents that makes lullabies so sweet. A scientific study involved recording the voices of several mothers while they were singing lullabies to their baby, and then repeating the process by recording the singing of the same lullabies by the same people in an empty room pretending to have their baby with them. The difference between the two could be easily identified. Children become programmed to those lullabies regularly sang by their parents' nights after nights. The lullabies work as a stimulus; and whenever that stimulus is given, the children fall asleep as the brain has become ""conditioned"" to it. So much so, even now if we listen to those songs, it will make us sleepy. Whatever the rationale, we all have sweet, fond memories regarding lullabies. Since they occurred very early in our life, the pictures in our mind are very hazy. I strangely believe that no memory is ever lost; every memory is stored; it's somewhere out there inside the brain. And sometimes, all you need is the correct stimulus, and the feeling of a long-lost experience might sometimes just surface, very vividly. The song playing on the radio was taking its toll on me. I would fall asleep any moment now. The boat was rocking with the flow of the current underneath. But I was lying on my bed. Was I dreaming? What is the specific boundary between sleep and wakefulness? Yes, it had all come back. The gigantic sky above me was glowing red. Innumerable miles below, frogs were croaking; crickets, ""cricking; large, ghost-like banyan trees, hissing. I was trying to gulp the rare beauty of a night that I seldom encountered: ""Majhe majhe tobo dekha pai, Chirodin keno pai na""","Thu May 8, 2025 04:35 PM         Last update on: Thu May 8, 2025 04:41 PM"

","Let's be honest, no matter how much we complain, summer in Dhaka has its charm. While on the one hand, there is the sweltering heat; on the other, there are sudden rains that drench our souls with love. And how can we forget those lovely dawats and parties where we let our hair down and dance the night away! A blouse makes a saree, and the woman in it. Earlier considered to be nothing more than a slip, like its sister (the humble old petticoat), a blouse received neither love nor attention. Sure, every saree came with a similar blouse piece with a matching border, but that was it. The earlier generation of women was not big on showing skin either and would wear blouses with mid-length or long sleeves, wrapping the anchal over their shoulders, keeping the blouse under wraps. Well, that has changed and how! Nowadays, the blouse is all-important, much to the chagrin of our mothers! What's more, a halter neck blouse in silver lamé will hardly raise brows anymore. Rather, it is a perfect outfit for a summer soirée. Times have changed, and so has our lifestyle, which is much more cosmopolitan and worldly than it ever was. It is only natural that our wardrobe reflects that evolution where the east effortlessly meets the west to create stunning styles. A deep-plunge bralette-style blouse will complement your chic golden georgette tissue saree that, again, is another modern innovation by master textile designers who have reinvented the stiff tissue in a more fluid, diaphanous way. Wear it to a reception party being hosted outside of Dhaka, in a beautiful resort. A low-cut blouse with mid-length sleeves is equal parts sensual and elegant. Drape your saree like the iconic ladies did in the swinging sixties — in a slim single fold and show off your toned clavicle. Cocktail sarees ooze oodles of oomph thanks to the cocktail blouse! Chic and sophisticated, show off your chiselled back in a backless blouse to the next cocktail night or your designer friend's fashion show. Saving the best for the last, say hello to the spaghetti strap bikini blouse that is bound to make you the belle of the ball. Worn with a gota-patti saree on a summer evening or a svelte chiffon saree for an elegant dinner party, the versatile style is just right for the fabulously stylish you!   Model: Arnira

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dilnawaz-dance-drama-where-love-transcends-the-mortal-veil-3892216","Dilnawaz: A dance drama where love transcends the mortal veil","Drawing from Sufi philosophy and fusing classical and contemporary dance traditions, Dilnawaz offers not just a spectacle, but an experience of the soul's deepest longings. Produced by Shadhona and directed by Lubna Marium, this performance revives a forgotten fable from Urdu literature, bringing to life the story of a slave girl, whose journey through love leads her to spiritual transcendence. Drawn from the lost but resurrected short story by Rahat Ara Begum, a writer whose pen was once silenced by political divide. The production charts the inner odyssey of a handmaiden in a royal court. Dilnawaz, the humble slave girl, traverses the perilous terrain of longing and surrender, her love for an oblivious prince becoming her gateway to spiritual transcendence. Her journey, told in seven movements that echo the seven stages of Sufi love, is anything but servile. Attraction (hub), Infatuation (uns), Love (ishq), Trust (akidat), Worship (ibadat), Madness (junoon), and finally, Annihilation (fana) — each stage strips away another layer of self, until only pure essence remains. Through a deft fusion of the Mugham dance traditions, Indian classical Kathak, and the sinuous rhythms of contemporary jazz, the dance drama embodies the universal yearning for union; not merely with the beloved, but with the Divine. It is no accident that Rahat Ara Begum — herself a practicing Sufi in 1940s Kolkata — wove this mystical thread into her only foray into mythic storytelling. And it is fitting that her granddaughter, Lubna Marium, would spend ten patient years nurturing this vision, culminating in six intense months of rehearsal to bring Dilnawaz to the stage. ""Not a dry eye in the hall,"" Marium recalls, but she stood firm for the story, and demanded nothing less than total devotion. Mubasshira Kamal Era, who embodies Dilnawaz, delivers a performance that goes beyond dance; it becomes ritual. Her portrayal captures heartbreak and ecstasy in equal measure, her body a vessel for emotions that words cannot contain. ""For a whole 10 minutes, I just spun,"" she says. ""I was in a trance. The claps, the awe in the audience, I could feel them, though they didn't reach me. My body was just in a trance, something I felt from within."" That moment, a solitary figure spinning, lost in divine madness, became the production's heartbeat. Era's own journey adds another layer of poignance: once driven away from dance by bullying, she returned years later to stand before an audience of over 700, everyone on their feet, caught in collective rapture. Dilnawaz is not content with mere narration. It communicates, blending classical rigor with contemporary freedom, weaving South Asian and Middle Eastern traditions into a single fabric. Each movement, each gesture, is charged with the sacred duty of conveying the ineffable. It is this alchemy that has left audiences spellbound and hearts unguarded. As Lubna Marium puts it, ""Performance transcends the world through art. With Dilnawaz, we present a story of love, devotion, and mysticism, weaving together South Asian and Middle Eastern performance traditions."" At a time when art is often reduced to entertainment, Dilnawaz reclaims the stage as sacred space. It reminds us that love, in its truest, most transformative form, is both the path and the destination. Like the Sufi seekers before her, Dilnawaz dances not for applause, but for annihilation. And in doing so, she invites us to shed our own layers, to spin until we too, touch the eternal.   Photo: Courtesy

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/adolescence-series-sparks-conversations-modern-parenting-3886511","Adolescence series sparks conversations on modern parenting","Inspired by true events, ""Adolescence"" traces the thoughts and actions of a teenager in modern Britain. Delving deep into the psyche of the protagonist, this show brings out the severity of unregulated internet usage on impressionable minds and how this is shaping the way society is functioning at large. On the surface, it seems innocuous enough. Just another thirteen-year-old with a smartphone trying to make sense of the world around him, leaning heavily on, well, social media and the internet. And then, as one peels off the layers, shocking revelations emerge! Jamie Miller, the protagonist, is looking for guidance and support in navigating his emotions and understanding of the world around him. When he finds none, Miller turns to motivational speakers such as Andrew Tate and the likes of him to shape his ideas regarding the opposite sex and how to tackle his feelings about them. What is extremely disturbing is that an entire generation of youth is depending on such volatile individuals with zero credibility for emotional guidance. Before ""Adolescence"" aired, there was not much dialogue surrounding the trend. It was not like we were not aware of the negative impacts of unregulated internet usage, but now it's more real than ever. Jamie Miller's inner turmoil and eventual outburst made me, a parent of pre-pubescent children, and parents like me everywhere sit up and take notice. The build-up of the series is eerily similar to the way our thoughts shape around an unexpected event — one does not anticipate an impending calamity, and once in the throes of its aftermath, anxiety and tension ensue, and eventually our lives aren't quite the same. From a regular viewer's neutral standpoint, this is a remarkable tale of lack of attention and understanding from the parents' part and how easy it is for children to get derailed in today's fast-paced world. For parents, however, it is like a punch in the gut. Am I spending enough time with my children? Are they doing okay in school? How are they viewing friendship, and are they getting accepted by their peers for being who they are? The greatest takeaway of the show remains the time-honoured values and principles of parenting — spend time with your children; be more involved with them. As easy as it might be to just hand them a device to catch a much-needed break (the lord knows we all need it) — hold back! Engage with them, do fun things together and try to get to know them. Their hopes, dreams, fears, wants, needs. Children learn from parents and nurture the love, affection, kindness and empathy they receive at home. What they see at home, they imprint and mirror in their lives. Healthy relationship models at home are likely to encourage them to display similar behaviours outside too. None of us is trained in child psychology, and it is impossible to discern at times what is really happening in their tangled minds. Yet, the only way to find out is by being a part of their lives, however they want us to be. Without judgment or condescension. Most importantly, we must be judicious in allowing children to have access to social media. Constant connectivity is a source of stress and anxiety for adults, even more so for children and young children whose brains are still in the developmental stage. ""Adolescence"" is more than just a show — it's a stark reminder that parenting in the digital age requires presence, patience, and proactive involvement. If we don't step in, someone else — often unqualified and potentially harmful — will. Let this be our wake up call to listen more, judge less, and truly connect with the young minds growing up in an increasingly disconnected world.","Sun May 4, 2025 04:01 PM         Last update on: Sun May 18, 2025 03:14 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/look-rich-spend-less-thrifting-bangladesh-3886461","Look rich, spend less: Thrifting in Bangladesh","Previously looked down upon as a mark of stinginess and perceived as unhygienic by many, the trend of buying second-hand clothing is picking up nicely in the wake of climate change conversations and environmental awareness. Described using enticing terms like ""pre-loved"" or ""pre-worn,"" thrifting usually involves the purchase of gently used items at reduced rates. Aside from eco-consciousness, fashion-forward people around the world appreciate this new trend for the uniqueness of the items it offers, self-expression and nostalgia for older or vintage pieces. Unlike fast fashion, which bulk produces similar-looking clothing, thrift shopping allows consumers to cultivate a distinctive style of their own. While the concept of online thrifting might be relatively new in the country, the practice of exploring flea markets for unique finds has been a traditional practice for decades. While touted to be export-quality stock lots that have minor defects, not all of these items are brand new. It is important to note, however, that most buyers around the world, including those in Bangladesh, have primarily been drawn to thrifting for its affordability, rather than the environmental benefits and sustainability of recycling clothes. This is because thrift stores often provide high-quality items at a fraction of the price of conventional marketplaces. Nusrat Jahan Mumu, co-owner of the Facebook page ""Dhaka Thrift"", has been in the resale business of pre-loved clothing for four years now. ""I started Dhaka Thrift as nothing but a business. It was in the thick of the pandemic, and I missed roadside shopping,"" she says. Mumu knew that many like her missed thrifting, and she could attract customers through quality control and low prices. However, thanks to the rising awareness of climate change in the country and the influence of social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, interest in second-hand shopping has significantly risen. The COVID-19 pandemic heightened this trend further, as individuals became more mindful of their consumption habits. ""Customer awareness has come a long way from when I opened shop in 2021,"" says Nusrat Jahan Mumu. ""When I saw that more and more customers were turning to my page inspired by a will to do something for the climate, I started educating them."" The young entrepreneur says she was quite transparent on her page about the group being one that strictly sold second-hand clothing items. She fought stigmas and hygiene misconceptions around thrifting by taking measures to ensure quality, such as thoroughly cleaning and repairing clothing. She meticulously curated her collection, ensuring that only items in good condition were offered to customers. ""The demand did not diminish even when people knew these items were pre-worn. That tells you that customers are willing to give this concept a chance if it lets them buy a good quality article of clothing at a reasonable rate,"" she added. The owner of yet another Facebook group called ""Decluttering Your Wardrobe"", Aysha, mentions that when she was using another name for her online business, it was not as popular. However, when she switched to words such as ""Recycle Bin"" and ""Declutter"", people flocked to her group in droves. ""I have hundreds of member requests per day, which means people are quite interested in the reselling of their clothes and other items of personal use. It is not an alien concept anymore,"" Aysha says. Endorsed by celebrities and influencers, trends like ""fashion flipping"" — the practice of purchasing second-hand clothing to resell it — and ""thrift flipping,"" which involves upcycling thrifted items into new creations, further cement the sustainability of pre-loved shopping within mainstream fashion. Thrifting and buying pre-loved clothes can allow shoppers to recycle their own clothing, consequently reducing their carbon footprints. Nusrat, Aysha and entrepreneurs like them have an added advantage — they can make money out of it, providing many people with a source of supplementary income from their sales and platform fees. Shopping aside, the green mindset adopted in the country has ushered in some practical habits which are both environment and budget-friendly. Rubab Khan, 32, recommends clothes swapping amongst like-minded friends. Clothes swapping is cost-effective and certainly doesn't compromise your sense of fashion or hygiene. ""Buying clothes every week is not something I've practised, even if I could afford it. I am one person; realistically speaking, how many clothes do I ACTUALLY need?"" The communications professional further highlights that our dependency on consumer culture often creates an illusion that everyone can afford everything in the same manner, which is not the case. ""Even if you come from the same social class. It's like if you don't jump that 'add to cart' bandwagon, you're somehow missing out on the latest trend."" A variety of Instagram shops curate second-hand culture, such as Vintage Ziana, @aesthrift.bd, Dhaka Vintage, and Thrift Store BD, among others. These platforms allow shoppers to discover incredible pieces at prices ranging from Tk 300 to Tk 700, making them accessible to many. Facebook platforms such as Dhaka Thrift and Decluttering Your Wardrobe have gained popularity by offering unique wares. With more and more people opening up to the idea of second-hand shopping, this cultural shift encourages a new appreciation for clothing and its stories, moving away, thankfully, from the fast fashion mentality. As we navigate this evolving landscape, it is becoming increasingly clear that thrifting is a lifestyle choice that holds the power to bring positive changes in our society.","Sun May 4, 2025 02:44 PM         Last update on: Sun May 4, 2025 02:49 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dhakas-own-sufia-easel-art-heart-3885701","Dhaka's own Sufia Easel: Art with heart","It is heart-breaking, and at the same time, it feels good, like everything together makes it feel like being in a nightmare; a kind of daze — This is how Sufia Easel describes the feelings behind her art. It is a layered emotion drawn from personal struggles with anxiety and depression, a theme that runs quietly but powerfully through her work. Sufia Easel graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design from the University of Development Alternative (UODA) in 2018. After working two jobs, she decided to fully focus on her passion: painting, and building a small business selling merchandise based on her artworks. ""I used to do a lot of pencil drawings before, mostly celebrity portraits,"" she shared. One of her most notable moments was when her fan art sketch of singer Shayan Chowdhury Arnob caught attention. ""Once, in Arnob's documentary 'Adhkhana Bhalo Chele Adha Mostaan', the director Abrar Athar contacted me,"" she said. ""He told me that my fan art is beautiful and they want to use it as the thumbnail image for the Chorki documentary poster."" Easel happily agreed, marking an early milestone in sharing her work with a wider audience. Today, watercolour is her primary medium. She prefers working with darker, moody themes — loneliness, memory, and emotional turbulence. ""The theme I work with is usually dark or moody,"" she explained. ""Like depressive mood...the various dark motifs that are in our surrounding environment."" In paintings like ""Alone with Letters and Memories,"" she created a self-portrait standing in front of a wall filled with old memorabilia: diaries, letters, and envelopes. ""The inspiration was from the city... there, two things are very commonly seen — neon lights and rows of buildings. In that urban setting, people often sit alone at home, looking at old photo albums and memories,"" she said. She also explored rural settings in her art — a painting with a boy reading a book by candlelight, another featuring herself and a rabbit under trees. ""The light there is candlelight, not neon,"" she said, pointing out the different emotional tones she captures between urban and rural spaces. Despite the emotional depth of her paintings, selling them has not always been easy. ""My paintings often take 100 to 150 hours to complete,"" she said. ""Big artworks take a lot of time, very painstaking detail."" Because of this, the pricing can be high, making it difficult for many to buy her original work. ""Many people might like the art but cannot afford it,"" she added. To address this, Easel started selling merchandise — mugs, notebooks, tapestries, and canvas prints based on her original artwork. ""I hope that since I have started releasing merchandise, everyone will be able to buy my art,"" she said. Looking ahead, she has plans to improve further. ""I want to license my merchandise business,"" she shared. She is also interested in producing archival-quality giclée prints, so that people can own high-quality reproductions of her painstaking watercolour work without the cost barrier of an original. Easel is clear-eyed about the challenges artists face in today's fast-changing world, especially with the rise of AI-generated art. She drew a sharp line between digital painting and AI generation. ""Digital painting has its charm; it needs to be done with a graphics tablet,"" she said. ""But AI-generated art, I won't say that it's art. Art is something that requires specialised skills, thinking, and inspiration. Art is not generated; it is created."" She worries that serious artists will be unfairly side-lined if AI-generated works are treated the same as human-made art. ""It seems to me that AI is like many fashion design games...it cannot be placed in the category of real art,"" she added. As for the future, Easel's plan is simple and honest — ""I want to draw many more beautiful pictures in my own style, my own theme, my own colour,"" she expressed. ""And one day, I hope to open my own studio."" For Sufia Easel, art is not about speed or shortcuts. It's about sitting with memories, with wounds, with moments of fragile sweetness — and patiently painting them into something that lasts.   Photo: Courtesy

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/old-dhaka-weddings-flavours-and-traditions-3882986","Old Dhaka Weddings: Of flavours and traditions","In Old Dhaka, while couples unite in holy matrimony, family and friends celebrate over a hearty helping of polao and meat dishes. Kachchi biriyani has emerged as the quintessential wedding dish, but a flashback to the bygone days will probably remind one of saffron-infused murg polao. So, how did Old Dhaka's palate change from a love for decadent chicken recipes to a mutton staple? This is that story — one of taste, family, and much more. From Chawk Bazar, an eight-minute walk through Jail Road will take you to our destination: 48 Abul Hasnat Road. Residents of this establishment are the illustrious Syed family. Their household is a witness to the confluence of culture that has taken place in the old town, as they have lived in this same location for more than three centuries. ""If you talk about wedding food, you must appreciate that assimilation of traditions has taken place and there is no longer an exclusive 'Dhakaiya menu.' This was not the case even five decades ago,"" said Syed Ahmed Ali, who himself is a food connoisseur. ""True, certain customs are still very much in place, but at the end of the day, it is kachchi, chicken roast, and rezala that reign supreme,"" he added with a smile. Perhaps, the diversity in an Old Dhaka wedding lies not in the preparation of the dishes, but in its epicurean culture, how a long list of food-related rituals makes it the centre stage of all Old Dhaka weddings. Zeenat Parveen serves as the president, Jahanara Foundation Museum located at Bangshal and has been a keen observer of the Dhakaiya lifestyle for decades. ""Weddings are an elaborate affair for the people of old Dhaka, starting with the paanchini, jamai khawon, balabali, and the biye. They are then followed by a series of post-wedding events like boubhat and firani,"" Parveen says. She adds, ""At one point in time, each of these events had features unique to the locality and the community that lived there. To this day, the paanchini or baatpakka, for instance, remains a significant event in Old Dhaka weddings."" In Muslim marriages, the day also marks the settlement of the wedding mahr (dower) through consultation and mutual understanding. The groom is kept away from these discussions, and to compensate for the missed feast of the baatpakka, the custom of ""jamai khawon"" evolved. The idea is simple — the bride's family sends food to the groom, for his entourage, and members of the closely-knit community. Traditionally, the list of food sent for jamai khawon was long and varied and to this day, carrying all the dishes from the bride's household to the groom's place often involves a truck! While the pomp of this ritual remains a fond practice among Dhakaites, the extravagance raises questions. One can easily argue that jamai khawon should serve as a reminder that one must strike a balance in preserving cultural heritage while at the same time coming to terms with modern-day sensibilities. It is surprising to many that the quintessential wedding dish of Dhakaites involved neither beef nor mutton. So, what was the secret to the popularity of chicken? The answer is in the secrets of the Mughal kitchen. The preparation of the polao was a laborious process and considerably different from how it is now cooked in households of Dhaka and beyond. In his book, 'Dhakai Khabar O Khaddo Sangskrity,' food historian Saad ur Rahman chronicles the elaborate method of cooking murg polao. ""Four chickens cut into 16 pieces were mixed with one kilogram of fine-grained, chinigura rice and this was slow-cooked along with raisins, a variety of nuts, alu Bukhara, clarified butter, milk cream, and saffron,"" Rahman mentions. He adds, ""The meat and rice were mixed in such a precise manner that the meat would stand out from the grains. The rice would soak the ghee and have an oily texture, but never greasy, to release the oil when pressed."" The Mughal, murg polao was devoid of green chillies or fiery spices. It is easy to imagine that the dish that comes out of our modern kitchens is pale in comparison to the authentic murg polao once served at various wedding events.  A noteworthy culinary tradition at wedding events was that burhani was never followed by firni but rather, jarda or mutanjan. Fine grain rice steeped in saffron and mixed with cashew, raisins, almonds, khoya, and topped with slivers of silver leaf. What makes it extraordinary are the shreds of well-seasoned, subtly sweetened meat! Although known as a festive delicacy, kachchi biryani gained prominence as a wedding dish after the migrations following the Partition of 1947. According to Zeenat Parveen, the rich and hearty nature of kachchi biriyani made it an ideal choice for wintry celebrations. This Central Asian dish reached a pinnacle of taste in the hands of our local chefs, and it is now prized for its warmth and decadence. ""The enduring appeal of kachchi lies in its ability to serve as a complete, standalone meal. With its luxurious blend of tender mutton, aromatic rice, and perfectly balanced spices, it quickly earned its place as the quintessential dish for Dhaka weddings, blending tradition with indulgence,"" she said. Marriages are made in heaven, and Bengali weddings are incomplete without events brimming with good food. Like a flowing river, traditions evolve. From chicken delicacies to today's staple kachchi, Old Dhaka's wedding menus too, have changed. A decade ago, serving naan and vegetables before kachchi was unheard of — perhaps 50 years from now, this ""novelty"" will be part of our wedding culture and something to write about.   Photo: Orchid Chakma This article was written as part of a collaboration between Star Lifestyle and Goethe-Institut Bangladesh.","Tue Apr 29, 2025 03:15 PM         Last update on: Tue Apr 29, 2025 03:27 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/shakrain-kites-and-tastes-old-dhaka-3882166","Shakrain: Kites and tastes of Old Dhaka","Every year, on the evening of 14 January, a walk around the streets of Old Dhaka would reveal an unfamiliar vibe in the familiar streets as Dhakaites prepare to celebrate Shakrain. Along with the lively chatter on the streets, rooftops become active, and the sky turns into a battleground for aerial kite fights. Marking the end of Poush on the Bengali calendar, ""Poush Sankranti"", as it is known, is not just about outward celebrations. As kites soar high in the air, households remain busy preparing traditional Bengali pithas, rice cakes, and other treats that bring families and neighbours together. Among Dhaka's oldest neighbourhoods, Narinda is noted for landmark structures like the Binat Bibi Mosque, established in 1452 C.E., the famed Baldha Garden, and the historic Christian cemetery. As you stroll around the neighbourhood, you will come across eateries like Beauty Lassi and Jhunur Polao, which add a gastronomic layer to the fabric of this famed locality. Syed Jahangir, 74, has lived here for the better part of his life and can trace his ancestral roots in Narinda's Lalmohan Saha Street. For generations, his family has witnessed the glory days of Old Dhaka, its fall from prominence, and a recent but renewed interest in its history and culture.   ""Shakrain is now observed by the entire community of Old Dhaka,"" he said. ""To this day, Narinda remains one of the hotspots of the Shakrain festival."" Strolling through these streets, one feels a sense of unity as residents prepare for the celebration. It seems that while the rituals of the occasion have not been fully adopted, the festivities have been widely accepted and practised. Syed Jahangir gave us a snippet of his earliest recollections of the festivities, which would always begin at dawn. ""Soon after morning prayers, families would gather around a spread of delectable pithas prepared by the women of the household,"" he said.  For over forty years, Nasima Jahan has held the mantle of the Jahangir family. She shared that the fragrant rice cakes somewhat symbolised the warmth of the tradition. ""The preparations for the elaborate breakfast would begin days before as the finest rice grains from the harvest were sourced, husked, and chipped or powdered for making pithas. The best quality jaggery and date palm juice were also used as sweeteners,"" Jahan shared. This was also a chance for the seniors to once again show off their culinary skills to their sons-in-law, as they were the special guests of this yearly tradition.  ""By 8 AM everyone would have been on the rooftops with their kites, ready to engage in aerial duels,"" mentioned Syed Jahangir. He added, ""Popular songs from the silver screen would play in the background as an encouragement for the 'fighters.'"" The whiff of mustard oil from the kitchen signalled that lunch was ready. Both Syed Jahangir and his wife, Nasima Jahan, recalled that back in the day, and even today, Shakrain's lunch was incomplete at their household without beef tehari. ""In my family, duck meat was served along with the occasional game father would bring from his hunting adventures,"" Nasima Jahan added. ""This was eaten with warm, soft chitoi pithas.""   As the day progressed, an air of excitement would build along the lanes, with the kite-flying matches reaching their heights. There were standard rules for the game with score sheets, and by sunset, the winners would be decided. ""Traditionally, the Shakrain festival would have been wrapped up by sundown. An evening snack of pithas and fritters ended the evening on a high note,"" said Nasima Jahan. As the event drew to a close each year, families and friends left the rooftops not just with memories of kite fights but with the lingering taste of Dhaka's beloved dishes. The food of Shakrain and the diverse flavours still keep the spirit of the festival alive. Syed Murtaja Jahangir, an investment professional, recalls celebrating Shakrain with his parent since the early 1990s. ""While the festival once revolved around local favourites like pithas and tehari, the modern-day versions include tandoori and barbecue — dishes that have found their way into Old Dhaka's rooftop scene alongside the kites. ""Walking past various rooftops now, the smell of grilled skewers is often stronger than that of the traditional rice cakes. Honestly, the younger generations look forward to grilled skewers more than the pithas,"" noting the changes in taste and tradition.  Murtaja has had the opportunity of witnessing Shakrain being celebrated in its more orthodox forms along with the 21st-century additions. ""By the early 2000s, as far as the celebrations were concerned, kite flying was now accompanied by music loaned from Bollywood, soon to be replaced by Western chart-toppers,"" he said. Now things have become quite 'chaotic' with DJs being hired and fire-spinners in action. This change is expected but perhaps not accepted by a majority of the people. For senior citizens like Syed Jahangir and Nasima Jahan, this is not the way they want Shakrain to be celebrated. Even Murtaja, their son, has reservations. ""Traditionally, the festivity would have been wrapped up by sunset. An evening snack of pithas and fritters drew the curtain of Shakrain for a whole year. Yet, as you pass by, some rooftops now remain alight with dancing and music well into the night."" Shakrain in Narinda beautifully captures the spirit of a community bound by tradition and good food. While evolving tastes and modern additions reshape its celebrations, the festival remains a cherished marker of Dhaka's cultural heritage. It has united generations in the past and continues to do so today.   Photo: Orchid Chakma

A designer with a timeless vision, Chowdhury is renowned for her fashion label, WARAH, where she focuses on Khaadi, Muslin, and Jamdani, creating enduring masterpieces that highlight local fabrics and honour our rich heritage. They say a creative mind's thirst for creation never ends, and this is especially true for Rumana Chowdhury. Not only has she been a dominant force in the fashion world for years, but she also plans to go beyond mere fabric and form. MW Bangladesh, where Chowdhury leads as both publisher and editor, is yet another platform where her vision shines. ""I aimed to develop something that was not limited to fashion. Something that enabled me to connect with heritage in a more nuanced, vibrant manner,"" Chowdhury shared, explaining her vision. The magazine serves as a platform through which she delivers content of global standards, all while staying deeply rooted in cultural identity. ""Bengal in Motion"" began as a signature platform of the magazine, an event that fosters beautiful collaborations while promoting Bangladeshi artists. It not only provides a space for them to showcase their talents but also offers glimpses of our rich culture to both national and international audiences. Last year's Bengal in Motion was a mesmerising tribute to the timeless power of dance, featuring iconic forms like Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Manipuri, and more.

With performances spanning diverse dance forms to captivating dance dramas, the event envisions a magical evening steeped in culture and heritage. Chowdhury expresses, ""Tagore was never just a poet or a musician — he represented a universe. His creations resonate across time, connecting with every aspect of our being: our uncertainties, our aspirations, and our deep desire for acceptance."" Every detail — from décor to ambience — bears Chowdhury's artistic touch: simple yet heartfelt, traditional yet modern. The event's visual narrative reflects her design philosophy, crafting a festive atmosphere where creativity thrives and Tagore is celebrated in every corner. Rumana Chowdhury concluded by expressing her heartfelt gratitude to MAYA, the natural wellness brand by Square Toiletries, acknowledging that such a remarkable event would not have been possible without their generous support.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/the-dhaka-nawabs-and-their-culinary-adventures-3882051","The Dhaka Nawabs and their culinary adventures","Overlooking the Buriganga River, Ahsan Manzil stands as an architectural and historical gem of Old Dhaka. The palatial building was home to the Nawabs of Dhaka during the British Raj, a political seat and an embodiment of affluence. Today, it is a museum — a testament to the once powerful dynasty — drawing local and foreign visitors alike. Of course, the foodie in you is bound to ask: what gastronomic delights did this aristocratic family treat themselves to? Before jumping to food, a basic history lesson is in order for the sake of setting a context. A good way to start is by asking, ""What do the people of Dhaka today remember the Nawabs as?"" Some may say they were the landlords who lived in the grand Ahsan Manzil, leading a lavish lifestyle. Others may point out that they paved the political landscape of Bengal. But many people will also fondly discuss the generous contributions the family made to the development of Dhaka. According to Banglapedia, the family's philanthropic activities included making hefty donations and spearheading projects for the development of water supply, electric supply, education, etc. Banglapedia further tells us that the colonial British government bestowed the title of Nawab upon Khwaja Abdul Ghani (1813-1896). He was the man who built Ahsan Manzil, named after his son, Nawab Khwaja Ahsanullah (1846-1901). Subsequently, Nawab Ahsanullah's son was Nawab Khwaja Salimullah (1871-1915), a legendary politician. The family's roots can be traced back to Kashmir. The Pink Palace — so called due to Ahsan Manzil's pink colour — is a majestic edifice, with its imposing staircase, spacious verandas, semi-circular arches, and, of course, the magnificent dome as the crowned jewel. The sense of splendour continues in the interior of the building. Case in point: the dining hall of Ahsan Manzil! The amused visitor sees a very long and elegant dining table, with beautiful crockery laid out. One can only imagine the sights, the clinking of spoons and plates, and the overall buzz of this dining hall during the olden times. To get a better picture, we spoke to writer and researcher Saad ur Rahman, general secretary of Dhaka Forum, who has authored several books on this city's food, culture, and history. He opined, ""I don't think that there was generally much chance to sit alone just with the family in the dining hall, because officials and relatives were always visiting Ahsan Manzil for various purposes and meetings, which would be followed by meals. The table would not be empty.""     On the other hand, Yasmeen Murshed, a family descendent — an eminent personality whose many roles include serving as an advisor of a previous caretaker government of Bangladesh — wrote in her book 'Khana Peena: Memories of Food and Family,' ""The dining room was the venue where the family gathered in full force for festive lunches and more formal dinners. The long table would be covered with dishes of food that teased the senses with their combination of aromas, so that one could hardly wait to reach out and fill one's plate."" The culinary treats of the Nawabs were numerous and varied, as Murshed pointed out in her book, ""The list of dishes is as long as the days of the year because variety was prized and jaded appetites had to be stimulated by the harried cooks and the supervising Begums."" Since the dynasty had Kashmiri origins, it comes as no surprise that many of their foods reflected that heritage. To illustrate, according to Rahman, the household used to serve Kashmiri tea, which was alien to our city and is not prevalent nowadays as well. This tea was of two types: namkin cha, (salty tea) and sheer cha (sweet tea).      Continuing with drinks, there was the exotic and rich namash or nimash, a winter delight described by Murshed as ""nothing less than whipped cream in tall cool glasses.""  The process involved putting out sweetened milk overnight in the cold air. Then, early in the morning, the laborious churning of the milk would produce the cream, poured into glasses and served. Another example of a speciality is khoshka. ""This is basically a goat's head — along with the meat as well — cooked with milk and ghee,"" Saad ur Rahman said. ""It is best to have it with plain rice."" Seems like a royal affair! Rahman continued, ""Kabli polao was very common and popular in the Nawab household. Do not confuse it with the kabli polao we are familiar with. It was different, using ingredients like kishmish, nuts, dalim fruit, saffron, and ghee. It was very expensive to make!"" If all that seems too distant and enigmatic, the dining spread also featured many other items which we are familiar with. In the book 'Dhakai Rondhonshoily,' Rahman mentions several iftar delicacies enjoyed by the nawabs that we all know of — albeit the taste or recipe may have been different or with a twist — such as kebabs, biriyani, doi bora, and falooda. In addition to Kashmiri recipes, the nawabs' eating habits were, of course, influenced by cuisines and popular delicacies of the Mughal, the British Raj, and Bengal — often cooked with their own preferences or inclinations in mind, as is the case with any household. For example, Yasmeen Murshed states in her book about Bengalis' favourite fish, hilsa, ""For the Family, hilsa was often cooked in yoghurt and flavoured with sugar and tamarind to give it a distinctive sweet and sour taste."" When we visit Ahsan Manzil, we think of the philanthropic works done by the people who once called it their home, the affluence of the family, and the politics they partook in.   One should also remember that the palate is as complicated as politics, and that Ahsan Manzil was a master of both!

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/preventing-dementia-through-yoga-3879236","Preventing dementia through yoga","As rates of dementia continue to rise worldwide, research is increasingly pointing to the role of lifestyle in protecting our health. Among the most powerful tools we have is yoga,  not just as a physical practice but as a comprehensive system that enhances mental clarity, emotional balance, and neural function. Yoga requires focused attention on multiple points at once: breath, alignment, movement, and internal body awareness. This complex engagement activates and strengthens various regions of the brain, building the kind of cognitive flexibility and resilience that guards against degeneration. Every yoga practice begins with the breath. Conscious breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, calming the stress response that, when chronic, can contribute to memory loss and cognitive decline. Deep, rhythmic breathing increases oxygen flow to the brain and improves circulation throughout the body. As the heart rate slows and the breath deepens, the brain receives more nourishment, helping maintain neural pathways and potentially creating new ones, critical for ageing with vitality and mental sharpness. Another powerful aspect of yoga is its ability to reduce chronic stress, one of the most insidious contributors to cognitive dysfunction. High cortisol levels — produced during prolonged stress — can damage the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning. Yoga provides a safe, embodied way to discharge stress through movement, breathwork, and meditative practices, allowing the body to process and release tension before it becomes toxic. Over time, this strengthens emotional regulation and improves overall brain function. Finally, yoga brings the practitioner into the present moment, training the mind to stay focused and aware. These mindfulness skills not only combat mental fog and distraction but also protect against the kind of mental disuse that can hasten dementia. Like any muscle, the brain needs stimulation to stay strong, and yoga, with its combination of physical challenge, breath control, and internal focus, is a multidimensional workout for body and mind. It is important that we recognise and honour yoga as not just a tool for flexibility or relaxation, but as a powerful practice for long-term cognitive health and clarity.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/scientists-say-theyve-found-new-colour-olo-3879226","Scientists say they've found a new colour, olo","Imagine a colour that's not on the rainbow, not in a crayon box, and not even something your brain has ever processed before. Sounds impossible, right? But according to a team of scientists in the U.S., that's exactly what they've done— uncovered a completely new colour that no human has ever seen naturally. They're calling it ""olo"", and it's being described as ""mind-blowingly vivid"". Now, before you try to Google what it looks like or check your screen for a swatch — don't bother. Olo is not something you can see on a screen or paint on a wall. In fact, you need special lasers aimed directly at your eyeball to see it at all. ""Olo"" came to life during an experiment in which laser pulses were carefully fired into the eyes of five volunteers. Although it sounds like something out of science fiction, it's very real, and the findings were published in the journal Science Advances. So, what exactly is ""olo""? According to Professor Ren Ng from the University of California, Berkeley — who not only co-led the research but also experienced the colour firsthand — it's a super intense blue-green shade that's ""more saturated than any colour you can see in the real world."" To help explain it, Ng said it's like living your whole life seeing only light pastel pinks, and then suddenly someone shows up wearing a shirt in the boldest, richest shade of red you have ever imagined. It's not that ""olo"" is red—it's just that different! The experiment that brought ""olo"" to life was published in Science Advances. It involved five participants, including some of the researchers themselves. Using a device affectionately called Oz (yes, like The Wizard of Oz), scientists fired ultra-precise laser pulses into the eyes of the participants. The goal? To isolate and stimulate a specific type of cell in the retina, the part of your eye that helps you see colour. Here's the nerdy but cool part: our eyes use three types of cone cells to see colour: S-cones for blue, M-cones for green, and L-cones for red. Normally, when you look at anything, these cones are all activated together in different combinations, which is how you get the full range of colours you see every day. In this experiment, the scientists managed to target only the M-cones, which does not naturally happen in real life. That unusual, isolated stimulation caused the brain to process a signal it had never encountered before. And the result was something totally new: olo! Each participant who saw the colour was then asked to use a dial to try and replicate it using a visible colour spectrum. All of them struggled because olo does not exist in our normal visual experience — it lies outside the colour boundaries your brain is used to. Not everyone is ready to call this a brand-new colour just yet. Professor John Barbur, a vision scientist from City St George's, University of London, praised the experiment as a major technological achievement but added a note of caution. He explained that changes in how cone cells are stimulated can make a colour appear more intense or brighter, but that does not necessarily mean it's a completely new colour. While this might sound like a strange side project for sci-fi fans, it could actually have serious implications, especially for people with colour blindness. If scientists can learn how to manipulate cone cells in such a targeted way, they might be able to help those who cannot perceive certain colours experience them for the first time. Professor Ng and his team are hopeful. They admit that seeing olo in everyday life is a long way off. You will not be able to experience it through a VR headset or a new smartphone anytime soon but the discovery could pave the way towards a deeper understanding of how vision works and how we might one day expand it. ","Thu Apr 24, 2025 03:04 PM         Last update on: Thu Apr 24, 2025 05:02 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/sarod-sisterhood-and-the-quiet-defiance-convention-3879216","Sarod, sisterhood, and the quiet defiance of convention","Their story is not about overnight success or going viral on social media. It's about continuity — not just of a musical tradition, but of familial responsibility, cultural defiance, and personal conviction. In an age of viral trends and digital distractions, the sarod does not exactly scream ""popular"". It doesn't feature in TikTok dance reels, nor does it fit easily into algorithm-driven playlists. And yet, in a modest room in Dhaka, two teenage sisters tune the strings of this 17 to 25-stringed instrument with the kind of reverence usually reserved for rituals. They are Ilham Fuljhuri Khan and Isra Fuljhuri Khan — known to most simply as the Fuljhuri Sisters. For Ilham and Isra Fuljhuri Khan, music was not a choice — it was an inheritance. Their father, Ustad Md Iliyas Khan is a tabla player; their mother, Supriya Akter, introduced them to vocal music early on. ""In our childhood, both of us had our teachings in singing from our mother and in tabla from our father,"" Ilham recalls. By 2015, the sarod entered their lives. ""Our father placed the first sarod in our hands,"" says Ilham. ""Since then, we've been learning together."" The weight of legacy is undeniable. ""We are the sixth generation in our family involved in music,"" Ilham notes. Isra adds, ""My paternal grandfather is Ustad Fuljhuri Khan, a Swadhinata Padak winner. And we are descendants of Ustad Alauddin Khan."" This is not a casual lineage. It's a living discipline — practised daily, carried with care, and quietly passed on through the fingers of two teenage girls playing an instrument most people their age cannot even name. Though both trained in vocals and tabla, it is the sarod that shaped their identity, so much so that audiences and organisers alike began referring to them simply as the Sarod Sisters or Fuljhuri Sisters. ""We didn't plan it,"" Ilham reflects. ""It just happened. We performed our first duet in 2017 at a Baithak at Bengal Parampara Sangeetalay. People liked it. And then it just stuck."" Performing mostly in duets, they have carved out an identity that balances individuality and synergy. Isra, the younger sister, is already composing her own pieces and working in studios on soundtracks, commercials, and projects. Ilham, balancing HSC exams and daily riyaz, maintains a quieter presence, but when they play together, there's no ""older"" or ""younger."" Just music. It's easy to romanticise their journey. Daughters of a musical dynasty, trained under maestros like Pandit Tejendra Narayan Majumdar and Kaushik Mukherjee. But the sisters are candid about the less pleasant parts. ""We live in a country where classical music is not prioritised. That's just the reality,"" Ilham says without bitterness. ""People think girls should not be out performing in the evening. And they don't stop."" Their defence? Silence. Practice. Progress. Their parents, especially their mother, have acted as the first line of resistance. ""My mother has endured more than people know,"" Ilham says. ""All so we would not have to."" Isra adds, ""People say things. I've stopped listening."" For now, they're focused on refinement. ""There's still so much to learn from our Guruji,"" Ilham says. Isra dreams of performing with him someday — not as equals, but as a disciple, on the same stage. Isra's broader aspiration is to make classical music more accessible, especially to people her age. ""Right now, children don't listen to it. Maybe they don't relate. I want to change that. Not to make it trendy, but to make it visible."" Their performances are slowly gaining ground in festivals and unconventional venues. Isra has already played with Chirkutt at the Joy Bangla Concert and in experimental platforms like Dhaka Makers and the Rishka Festival. Ilham, the quieter half, focuses more on the purity of form and on making it to her next exam without dropping her sarod. The Fuljhuri Sisters are not here to entertain the algorithm. They are here to hold onto something that many are letting slip — an entire vocabulary of music that predates YouTube, Spotify, and the attention economy. So, the next time you hear a drone of strings and mistake it for background score, listen a little harder. It might be two sisters, a pair of sarods, and generations of tradition, threading their way into a future that still has room for silence, depth, and sound that refuses to be forgotten.

No notifications, no pop-ups, no voice in your head asking you to just check your phone ""for a second"". Just you. And the words. And somehow… that was enough. The smell of the pages. That slightly musty, woodsy scent of old bookstores and secondhand novels. The faint crack of the spine opening for the first time. You remember the weight of a book resting on your chest as you read lying down, elbows sore, eyes barely staying open, but you HAD to finish that chapter. The dog-eared corners. The highlighter marks. The tiny scribbles you left in the margins, like you were talking back to the author. And, the second-hand books from Nilkhet — those were special. Underlined lines in unfamiliar handwriting. Notes in the margins from someone you'll never meet! Back then, you read before bed not because someone told you it was good for sleep hygiene… but because the story wouldn't let you go. You'd say ""one more chapter"" and lie to yourself with a full heart. You'd read on buses. In waiting rooms. Under the table at family gatherings. Pages became shields, doors, portals. And once you stepped in, you didn't want to come out. Now we scroll.
Aimlessly and endlessly.  Thumbs trained to flick before our eyes even register what we're looking at. We skim headlines. We like quotes from books we never actually read.  We save long essays for a time that never arrives. We open tabs with good intentions and close them days later without reading a word. Somewhere in the noise… the silence of books has been drowned out. Not gone yet, just… quieter. Muted beneath the static. There are reasons. Cold, clinical ones. Modern tech is engineered to keep you hooked.  Every scroll, every swipe, every ding and vibration. It's all formulated to be mini dopamine hits. Our brains are tricked into thinking they're chasing something important. A study by Microsoft found that the average human attention span has dropped from 12 seconds to just 8 seconds. That is shorter than a goldfish's. Another, from the University of California, Irvine, found that it takes 23 minutes and 15 seconds to fully regain focus after a single distraction. Now, imagine trying to read a chapter with WhatsApp blinking at you every three minutes. It's not that you don't love books anymore. It's just that our brains are exhausted. This isn't just about reading. This is about what we lost along with it. The slow, mindful quiet of a Friday morning, when nothing felt urgent. Remember the Fridays when all the distractions we had were pre-scheduled programs on BTV? There was joy in picking up a book at a store purely because the cover called to you. The luxury of being bored and choosing to read instead of scrolling. We didn't just lose focus. We lost presence. We lost the version of ourselves who did not need noise to feel alive.  Who could spend an entire afternoon with imaginary people and call it a good day. We lost the ability to sit with stillness… and not immediately flinch. A few weeks ago, I was trying to read on my laptop.  The house was quiet. My 6-year-old daughter was brushing her teeth, getting ready for bed. It was one of those rare moments. No calls. No meetings. Just time. I settled in with a book on my screen I'd been meaning to finish for months. Adjusted the brightness. Scrolled to my last read chapter. Then she climbed into my lap, small, warm, drowsy. ""Can you hold me instead?"" she asked. I smiled and said, ""Okay, but Baba's reading."" She looked at the glowing screen. And then, in that soft, sleepy voice kids have when they're on the edge of dreamland, she said,  ""Wouldn't it be better to read a real book?"" I didn't know what to say. I didn't read that night. I just held her. And stared at the screen. And thought about what she said. And how she was right. Fiction, our oldest escape, is now in competition with 10-second videos that fight for your attention within the first two seconds. Non-fiction used to challenge us. Now we want bullet points. Podcasts at 2x speed. We want knowledge without effort and wisdom without time. A friend's wife watches movies and videos at accelerated speed, making all characters sound like squeaky-voiced cast members from Alvin and the Chipmunks. We treat reading like it's a luxury. A hobby for people with fewer tabs open. When really, it was always a lifeline. We didn't stop reading because we don't care. We stopped because it became hard. Because life got busy. Because we got tired. Because the world kept asking us to be faster, louder, busier. But books? They've stayed the same. Quiet. Patient. Waiting. You won't finish a book. Maybe you won't even start one. But maybe you'll reach for one again.  Not as a goal. Not as a flex. Not for your ""currently reading"" shelf. But for that quiet place inside you that's been missing the stillness. Because if you've made it this far… you've read nearly 1,000 words. On a glowing screen. With a thousand distractions a tap away. Maybe that's the start of something. Maybe you remember what it felt like. And maybe, just maybe, that's enough for now.","Wed Apr 23, 2025 02:05 PM         Last update on: Sun Apr 27, 2025 06:04 PM"

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/fashion-beauty/news/ahmed-tuhin-reza-the-ultimate-panjabiwala-3876616","Ahmed Tuhin Reza: The ultimate panjabiwala","In the world of Bangladeshi fashion, Ahmed Tuhin Reza stands out as a visionary designer in men's traditional attire, particularly in the realm of panjabis. With an eye for both heritage and innovation, he has reshaped how men approach festive and everyday traditional wear. ""First thing for men is panjabi; there is no celebration of a traditional occasion in Bangladesh without the quintessential attire,"" Ahmed asserts. Interestingly, Ahmed Tuhin Reza, the Managing Director and Creative Director of House of Ahmed, notes that the panjabi has undergone substantial transformation over the years. ""Even 20 years back, fashion had not been incorporated into panjabis as it is now,"" he says.   The designer observes that today's generation is increasingly fashion-conscious and adventurous, exploring diverse designs to enhance their style.  Ahmed sees no harm in being influenced by foreign fashion. Rather, he believes that instead of altering the tastes of the Bangladeshi market, designers should adapt and incorporate global influences into their creations. ""If Bangladeshi people are inclined towards Bollywood or other influences, we should work on adopting fashion and making it our own!"" he says. As cultural perspectives shift around festivals, Ahmed observes an increasing demand for unique designs. ""Previously, festivals were not so creatively celebrated in the fashion space,"" he recalls. ""However, occasions like Pahela Baishakh have now redefined cultural expression, 'demanding rickshaw art and fun factors,' as well as more sophisticated designs for Eid and other celebrations."" On the topic of design influences, Ahmed expresses a fondness for the timeless appeal of white. ""White inspires me. It's a timeless colour; whether in normal cotton or full zardozi, white never goes wrong,"" he says. ""It completely depends on us,"" he asserts. By focusing on traditional fabrics like Jamdani, Muslin, and silk, Reza aims to create a luxury brand that showcases the richness of Bangladeshi craftsmanship. ""We have to give artisans good pay and quality of life to create a second line of craftsmen,"" he continues. He believes that elevating the artisans' quality of life will lead to a sustainable model, ultimately allowing Bangladeshi fashion to compete on a global scale. ""We work with foreign models as well, so we are trying to expand our reach,"" Ahmed Tuhin Reza adds, reflecting his commitment to not only improving local production but also showcasing Bangladeshi talent internationally. Ahmed's ambition extends beyond mere aesthetics; he envisions a future where Bangladeshi sensibilities in fashion can command a place on international runways. ""We promise the Bangladeshi people that we will make a Bangladeshi brand global,"" he states with palpable conviction. This goal is not solely about marketing but also about cultural representation, ensuring that the rich heritage of the Bangladesh textile industry is celebrated worldwide. Ahmed's journey with House of Ahmed, along with his wife Tanzila Elma, co-founder of HOA, illustrates the delicate balance between honouring tradition and pushing boundaries within the fashion industry. From the meticulous craftsmanship of muslin panjabis to the incorporation of modern aesthetics, Ahmed Tuhin Reza is tirelessly working to redefine what menswear can embody in Bangladesh. As he reflects on the current and future trends, it is clear to him that the world is ready for Bangladeshi fashion.

It definitely has an interesting vibe, and we Bengalis revel in its beauty. The best aspect of the season is that we get to let loose and be fancy-free, make the most out of the cruel summer by living and dressing light!  By drawing inspiration from nature, where an abundance of flowers bloom in the prettiest shades, designers come up with fabulous collections, which perfectly evoke summery vibes. Crimson Krishnachura is a national favourite; its boughs laden with bright orangey red blooms dazzle with their beauty, and his paramour Radhachura is somewhat mellow but equally charming; the vibrant yellow flowers bring happiness to our weary minds. And when lively rain washes all the leaves clean, the verdant leaves bring the coolness of the heavens to our eyes. Tenzing Chakma, revered designer, is a lover of nature, and his latest offering is inspired by the shades of summer. Bright, happy and sweet, the stunning collection has emerged from his creative mind, and it is just the thing to wear and flaunt this summer.  Indigenous textiles are known for their handloom designs and patterns. They are unique and distinctive from other regions, making them pieces one wants to have and to hold for years to come. Nowadays, fabrics woven by hand are extra special owing to their sustainable nature and high quality.
  Tenzing Chakma is a gifted designer whose repertoire includes ethnic as well as Western styles. He has always striven to bring indigenous style and culture to the forefront of Bangladeshi fashion. From dresses, sarees, to skirts, one is spoilt for options. A lovely leaf-green saree with delicate white patterns is fresh and vibrant, making it perfect for summer. One can wear it for work, classes, or leisurely pursuits like meeting friends for lunch. This design has many renditions like a woman's many different moods, and each and every colour is equally different and unique. Pinon hadi — a traditional two-piece outfit comprising a blouse and a straight skirt — proudly worn by Chakma women, is highlighted among all others. A delicate attire that's perfect for sweltering days of summer and city life, choose a pinon hadi as your outfit of choice for your next ladies' tea!
  The mango yellow pinon hadi is ripe for the taking, sweet and lovely. Its happy bedfellow is the orange one, lovely and citrusy; especially beautiful is the pomegranate coloured one that is truly one of a kind. The soft lilac one, reminiscent of ravishing blooms, is feminine and gorgeous. A rare shade that is neither pink nor red has been rendered in the most elegant colour that will make its wearer look simply stunning on summer days. Best part? Most of Tenzing Chakma's designs are available as sarees along with pinon hadi. So, whether you choose a saree or a hadi, you will look fabulous wearing any of these stunning designs.    Photo: Hill Valley Production

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/meet-the-bangladesh-wheelchair-cricket-team-3876576","Meet the Bangladesh Wheelchair Cricket Team","In the heart of Bangladesh, where cricket pulses through every lane and schoolyard, there is another league of players who redefine what it means to wear the national colours. Their bats may not swing with the same media frenzy, and their matches rarely see full stadiums. But their stories? They are the kind that rearrange your notions of strength. These are the warriors of the Bangladesh Wheelchair Cricket Team. And they play for dignity! When Mohammad Mohasin was just six months old, polio robbed him of the ability to walk, but it could never take away his love for sports. ""In the late '90s, after Bangladesh's win in the ICC Trophy, cricket fever swept the nation. I'd crawl onto fields near my home, trying to join the boys. Sometimes, I was mocked, left behind. It hurt. I used to wonder — what if people like me had our own team?"" he recalls. That dream turned into action in 2010, after Mohasin posted a photo of himself playing cricket in a wheelchair. Mohasin was asked if Bangladesh had a team for physically challenged cricketers. ""We don't,"" Mohasin replied. ""But we will."" He began emailing, calling, and campaigning. Then came a bold move: a wheelchair journey from Teknaf to Tetulia, to raise awareness about mobility rights. It made headlines. And slowly, people started to listen. ""We're proving that disability is not a limitation – society's mindset is,"" says Mohasin. ""Disability is not our barrier. Society is."" The road remains steep. Mohasin shares stories of being mistaken for a beggar, of strangers pressing coins into his hand.  ""People ask if my wife is also like me. Or if my children are normal. There's so little awareness."" While the Disability Rights Act of 2007 exists, Mohasin says implementation is weak. ""Even new buildings ignore basic accessibility. It's not about ramps. It's about mindset."" Md Rajon Hossain's voice is calm, but his words strike deep. ""People think we need to be pushed. They don't know we play cricket in wheelchairs."" Polio altered Hossain's life at age two, leaving him with limited sensation from the waist down, but it didn't take away his will. After joining the wheelchair cricket team, he found not just a sport but a brotherhood. ""In Dhaka, we used to train at a concrete court inside Dhaka University. Now, it's inaccessible. We've heard for years that we'll get a dedicated field – like the one near Parliament – but nothing has happened,"" he states. Even practising is a logistical nightmare. Most of the team members cannot afford transport, and public buses are hostile. CNG drivers charge extra when they spot a wheelchair. And sponsors are scarce. Hossain informs, ""In India or Nepal, grounds are prepared with trimmed grass for wheelchair games. We practise on fields with weeds and potholes. It slows us down, literally and figuratively."" Hossain runs a small computer business and still makes time for the sport. ""We fight on. Not just to play, but to live with dignity."" Md Ripon Uddin was 15 when he fell from a rooftop, severing his spinal cord. A fall that could have ended everything, but it did not. From a wheelchair, Ripon completed his SSC and HSC, scoring a GPA of 5 in HSC — the first in his college's history. ""Later, I got a scholarship at a university in Dhaka and completed both BBA and MBA in Finance."" Cricket came into his life in 2015 through Mohasin. ""Growing up, there was no space for people like us in sports. Families often treat disabled children as burdens. Disability is seen as a curse."" In 2017, Bangladesh hosted an international wheelchair cricket tournament in Dhaka. Teams from India, Nepal, and Pakistan joined. Bangladesh won. That win gave birth to the International Wheelchair Cricket Council (IWCC), with Mohasin as Secretary General. Since then, divisional tournaments have sparked new hope across the country. ""Some players used crutches or handmade boards to play. They didn't even have wheelchairs,"" Ripon says. ""Now, they represent divisions and carry the flag."" Still, exploitation looms. ""Some sponsors treat us like content — good for publicity, bad for investment. Managers eat up funds. Some mimic our initiatives to build their own brands."" But Ripon remains steadfast: ""We don't need pity. We need opportunity."" The Bangladesh Wheelchair Cricket Team's struggles mirror those of nearly one crore disabled people in the country. From inaccessible transport to hostile workplaces, the barriers are systemic. ""The Bangladesh Cricket Board has a huge budget. Yet, we have seldom received considerable support,"" says Mohasin. ""If we truly want inclusion, every company, every institution should hire at least one disabled person. That's how you learn what real accessibility looks like."" Despite limited resources, the team has worked with organisations like the US Embassy and UNDP. They have organised matches, awareness campaigns, and community outreach – all driven by the players themselves. Wheelchair cricket in Bangladesh is more than a sport. It's a defiance of limits imposed by society. It is the collective voice of those who have long been pushed to the margins, rising from the silence with the sound of a bat striking a ball. What they deserve is not just the spotlight but a seat at the table and a field that belongs to them just as much as it does to anyone else. Let them roll forward, not as an afterthought but as a force.   Photos: Courtesy","Mon Apr 21, 2025 02:23 PM         Last update on: Mon Apr 21, 2025 05:49 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/faridpur-dhaka-bamboo-artisans-holding-heritage-3876566","From Faridpur to Dhaka: Bamboo artisans holding on to heritage","When Sunita Rani Biswas arrived in Dhaka from Boalmari, Faridpur, she was not carrying luxury goods or designer fabrics. She carried something simpler: mats and bamboo baskets. For her, bamboo weaving is more than a skill; it's an inheritance. Her introduction to this craft did not come through formal training or curated workshops. She shared, ""My mother used to do this work. I would sit beside her and watch her hands move. That's how I learned."" Years later, that childhood fascination turned into a lifelong pursuit. ""After getting married, I took the initiative to do the work myself. Now, I cut, weave, and shape everything on my own,"" she added.  Biswas specialises in handwoven bamboo items, utility-based and decorative, each crafted with patience and care. However, like many artisans, her work is seasonal. Sunita Biswas was one of the featured artisans at Celebrating Bangladeshiness, a three-day event organised by Gunoboti, a creative platform working with traditional artisan communities, craft enthusiast individuals, and trained designers. Held at the Alliance Française de Dhaka, the exhibition brought rural artisans face-to-face with urban audiences through workshops, panel discussions, and open markets. Malobika Dipanwita Roy, Community Architect and Founder of Gunoboti, shared that Celebrating Bangladeshiness stemmed from both personal memory and a broader urgency.  ""This knowledge is fading,"" she warned. ""If we don't act now, we risk losing entire systems of traditional wisdom. ""Gunoboti is not about freezing traditions in time but creating spaces where they can evolve. Preservation cannot mean rigidity. Crafts must be allowed to grow with the times."" The story of Celebrating Bangladeshiness was not told in speeches or shared on social media posts. It was narrated with the sound of a blade slicing bamboo. In the way artisans carried their tools like they carried their names — worn, but never broken. It was told by people like Asim Biswas, also from Boalmari, who has spent decades bending bamboo into shape and survival.  ""I was eight when I started. We didn't have much, but we had bamboo. So, we made things –fans, stools, baskets. And we kept making them."" Like many artisans, Asim Biswas doesn't see himself as an artist. He sees himself as a provider, a keeper of a fading practice. ""There's always bamboo near our home. But the market? That comes and goes. People buy during festivals, and then forget us the rest of the year."" At the heart of the event was a panel discussion titled ""Handicraft Industry Product Diversification,"" where urban professionals, educators, and sustainability advocates tried to articulate what Sunita and Asim already knew: that the distance between the village and the capital is not just measured in kilometres. It's measured in visibility. The panel's experts spoke with urgency about reviving Bangladesh's fading craft heritage. Bishwajit Goswami stressed the loss of artistic identity to mass production, while Emerald Upoma highlighted bamboo as a sustainable alternative to plastic in children's toys. M A Maruf emphasised promoting artisans over products, and Syed Muntasir Ridwan called for integrating handcrafted traditions into a future-facing, sustainable Bangladesh. Sanlap Biswas, volunteer and lead investigator of the research, explained, ""We didn't organise this just to showcase crafts. We wanted to build a shared space where artisans and urban learners could connect, where traditional knowledge meets contemporary relevance."" Despite their skill and dedication, artisans like Sunita and Asim face an uphill battle. Many rely on occasional events or seasonal fairs for income. Others are considering abandoning the trade altogether due to a lack of consistent buyers. ""This industry is disappearing, but I believe it can survive if we all work together,"" Sunita Biswas said, adding, ""It feels good to be in Dhaka. Here, people saw our work and asked us questions. That rarely happens where we're from."" For Asim Biswas, the experience was just as affirming. ""To be part of something central like this — where the city sees and values our craft — gives me hope. I want this to happen more often, in more places."" While the event offered a rare moment of recognition for artisans like Sunita and Asim, one exhibition alone is not enough. For traditional crafts to survive, more regular and inclusive platforms are essential. Initiatives like this must be scaled up to provide visibility, market access, and design innovation. If supported consistently, these crafts can not only endure but thrive.

No reports. No spreadsheets. No ""quick syncs that spiral into hour-long existential crises."" Just good vibes, a questionable cup of office coffee, and the sweet sound of zero responsibility? If your answer is a hard no, congrats! You are probably the office MVP, the proud owner of colour-coded planners and a highlighter in every shade. The one who actually reads the meeting agenda! But if that little scenario made you smile a bit too hard? Welcome to the club. You, my friend, are one of us: the ordinary, low-effort daydreamer who just wants to exist, breathe, and somehow make rent. And while most of us are stuck daydreaming about this sweet, responsibility-free life, one man in Tokyo is actually living it. Shoji Morimoto, a middle-aged Japanese guy living in Tokyo, gets paid—yes, paid—to show up and exist! Sometimes he eats lunch with strangers. Sometimes he just listens. No deliverables. No KPIs. Just vibes and presence. For 10,000 yen (about $71) per booking, Morimoto will accompany you anywhere you like. He will not help you solve your problems, carry your shopping bags, or even make small talk. He will just be there. Existing. Calmly. Respectfully. Like a perfectly behaved ghost with a day rate. In a society obsessed with doing more, grinding harder, and monetising every waking second, Shoji Morimoto has found success by offering...nothing! It all started in 2018 when Morimoto—freshly fired from a job where he was accused of ""doing nothing."" His calendar is now packed with the kind of appointments that make you question the very fabric of capitalism. He has over 250,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), has written books about his lifestyle, and has clients who have hired him not once, not twice, but over 270 times. One could say he's got more loyal customers than some therapists, and with far fewer awkward silences—because those are exactly what he's selling. He currently takes on one or two clients a day. He doesn't advertise what he earns, but it's enough to live in Tokyo, support a family, and wear the same neutral outfit to work every day without any of the soul-sapping grinds that most of us accept as normal. He makes around $80,000 a year simply by being available… and not ruining anyone's vibe. And what does that say about us? Maybe we're lonelier than we admit. Maybe we're just exhausted from constantly performing, posting, and perfecting. Or maybe it says that we desperately need to spend more time doing... less.","Sun Apr 20, 2025 02:38 PM         Last update on: Sun Apr 20, 2025 03:08 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/preventing-dementia-through-yoga-3879236","Preventing dementia through yoga","As rates of dementia continue to rise worldwide, research is increasingly pointing to the role of lifestyle in protecting our health. Among the most powerful tools we have is yoga,  not just as a physical practice but as a comprehensive system that enhances mental clarity, emotional balance, and neural function. Yoga requires focused attention on multiple points at once: breath, alignment, movement, and internal body awareness. This complex engagement activates and strengthens various regions of the brain, building the kind of cognitive flexibility and resilience that guards against degeneration. Every yoga practice begins with the breath. Conscious breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, calming the stress response that, when chronic, can contribute to memory loss and cognitive decline. Deep, rhythmic breathing increases oxygen flow to the brain and improves circulation throughout the body. As the heart rate slows and the breath deepens, the brain receives more nourishment, helping maintain neural pathways and potentially creating new ones, critical for ageing with vitality and mental sharpness. Another powerful aspect of yoga is its ability to reduce chronic stress, one of the most insidious contributors to cognitive dysfunction. High cortisol levels — produced during prolonged stress — can damage the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning. Yoga provides a safe, embodied way to discharge stress through movement, breathwork, and meditative practices, allowing the body to process and release tension before it becomes toxic. Over time, this strengthens emotional regulation and improves overall brain function. Finally, yoga brings the practitioner into the present moment, training the mind to stay focused and aware. These mindfulness skills not only combat mental fog and distraction but also protect against the kind of mental disuse that can hasten dementia. Like any muscle, the brain needs stimulation to stay strong, and yoga, with its combination of physical challenge, breath control, and internal focus, is a multidimensional workout for body and mind. It is important that we recognise and honour yoga as not just a tool for flexibility or relaxation, but as a powerful practice for long-term cognitive health and clarity.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/modern-meets-cosy-bedroom-sets-every-taste-3873796","Modern meets cosy: Bedroom sets for every taste ","From beautiful additions to useful applications, today's modern bedroom furniture sets do well in every aspect. They smartly cater to the demands of your fast-paced life, juxtaposing function against flair and comfort against clean design. If you are looking to transform your bedroom with a touch of new and all things amazing in view, then explore the world of modern bedroom furniture sets to find the one that suits you best. Bedroom furniture sets that are light and airy impart a feel of space and serenity. A low-profile platform bed with simple wooden frames and a minimalist nightstand featuring smooth, understated drawers can resonate with the calmness in your bedroom space. You can also get a matching dresser, along with a wooden bench on the footboard for extra seating. A luxurious bedroom set could revolve around a sleek wooden bed that serves as the centrepiece, offering style and comfort. Along with this, reflective surfaces can add elegance to your mirrored nightstands. In this set, the dresser typically comes with a high-gloss finish, sometimes with metallic handles as well for a little shine. Add to that a tall-mirrored wardrobe or vanity table to round up the glam package of the room. This kind of set will be about your luxury, giving that polished, high-end feel and turning your room into a chic escape. The bold and contemporary bedroom set can centre on a bed constructed from dark wood, giving an edgy vibe from a single piece. To bring home an authentic urban feel, you can add nightstands made of reclaimed wood and accents. Moreover, a wooden or leather bench at the foot of the bed can serve as seating and storage combined, while rugged industrial-style lamps or wall-mounted shelves can complete the look. With this set, your bedroom will have strong furniture that makes its presence felt. A walnut bed frame can be used with a simple geometric modern design for a touch of character that can really make any bedroom shine. In this set, a nightstand can include things like simple drawers with creative leg designs. These details could also appear in the dresser, offering a retro-style. A wooden bench can be brought in to enhance the practicality of the set, while open shelving units could give room for display without clutter. The set will be a vintage design curated in a modern form, built into furniture that speaks of understated sophistication. Purchasing an entire bedroom set can give your place a fresh feel, however, it could be a considerable expense all at once. This is where EMIs come in handy.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/lifehacks/news/why-your-next-wedding-gift-shouldnt-be-blender-3873776","Why your next wedding gift shouldn't be a blender","Once upon a time, wedding gifts were given to couples as a token for their new life together. So, it was not rare to find a bride with a forced smile while unwrapping the fifth ice cream bowl set. These gifts were usually presented as material blessings, sometimes heavy enough to cause real shoulder aches. Somehow, in the present, that notion seems to have snowballed into the art of gift-giving that adds a few laughs and, at times, side-eyes. However, with mood boards, colour palettes, and digital wallets, wedding gifts are no longer surprises for the bride and groom; they are totally curated events. Nobody wants just ceramics anymore. In fact, couples do not need an ice cream bowl set, or already have one. What they do not have is support towards paying off that hefty wedding bill. And this is where cash comes in the conversation — light, effective, and perfectly foldable into a clutch or envelope. ""Cash was the best wedding gift for me. I got to use it to buy an AC, fans, refrigerator, and other home appliances when my husband and I began our marital journey. You could say it was a game-changer to buy our new life's much-needed necessities,"" shared Tasfia Tahrin, reminiscing about when her newlywed life began. Tasfia's words were echoed by several other couples who either utilised the cash they received to build their new home, or take a quick honeymoon trip. Needless to say, cash is that one gift that can fit any purpose of the bride and groom, all while keeping their smiles big. Now, for a controversial stand — crockery. Though often villainized, crockeries still have their undoubtable benefits. For a couple moving into a new house (read: still figuring what to buy), a good dinner set or a cooking pan can be crucial. This kind of gift will spare you all the extra fuss of sentimental pieces with flowers and gold rims. But, remember to keep it modern, sturdy, and microwave-safe. In the end, functionality will always triumph over excessive flair. Such sentiments were reinforced by 30-year-old Safin Howladar, who said, ""My wife and I were pretty torn over receiving so many crockeries in the beginning. But, once we got past that initial hesitation, we realised so many of them were actually helpful for us. I guess there will be multiple versions of the same crockeries, since not everyone knows the others' gifts, but we decided to give away the doubles and triples to our cousins who asked for a few of them.""   Nevertheless, if both cash or crockeries are out of your realm of possibilities, you can surely explore the world of gift cards! Gift cards are cash's cousin because while not being real cash, they are actually helpful; the couple gets freedom to choose, and you get pats on the back. It is thoughtful for them without breaching personal space. A gift card to their favourite restaurant or home store goes a long way to show your love for them. ""I had received a gift voucher from one of my favourite brands. It was worth a lot and I enjoyed shopping for me and my husband so much! When we were gifted sarees and panjabis, we did not really have any option but to accept them. But with the gift card, the choice was ours and that was the best part,"" expressed Tasnia Esha, who got married a year ago. Esha further added, ""Even cash was a remarkable gift for us. My husband and I took a trip to Thailand for 2 weeks with it!"" All that being said, there are people that still cling to the brass plates and the heroic effort to gift furniture. However, the modern couple usually looks with polite horror at those, wondering if selling it online would be insensitive or just practical. So, what can you wrap? Here are some safe bets: One, money. Two, more money. Three, some functional crockeries. Four, worthwhile items: dinner vouchers, a spa day, or a gift card. Five, if you really must give a physical gift, it should be something lovely, branded, and easy to exchange. Bengali weddings may be noisy, lengthy, and at times, puzzling, but when it comes to gifting, some rules are simple: Make it thoughtful, make it useful, and if that fails, just make it cash. Because, truth be told, nobody ever cried with sadness while opening an envelope full of money.","Thu Apr 17, 2025 09:14 PM         Last update on: Thu Apr 17, 2025 09:20 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/how-villages-keep-the-spirit-bengali-weddings-alive-3871661","How villages keep the spirit of Bengali weddings alive","A house, a big yard, huge pots of rice pudding, packets of colour, and pure wild turmeric paste scattered around, garlands of marigold, fairy lights, and colourful silk adorned across the yard and entrance, and lots of love, laughter, and joy. That's exactly how a rural wedding ceremony begins. One might think Bengali holud ceremonies are based on glamorous venues decorated with roses and ivory, aesthetically themed photo booths, dance performances on Bollywood songs from dusk till midnight during winter, and flashy, gorgeously dressed guests.  However, the authentic holud ceremony in the rural areas of Bangladesh is a completely different splash of colours. Instead of glamorous convention halls, these ceremonies are celebrated at home. All of this happens during summer, which is considered auspicious, instead of winter, when weddings in the city usually take place. It starts with the women of the house waking up before dawn to make 'kheer' or rice pudding, using the biggest pot to distribute around the neighbourhood, expecting blessings for the soon-to-be-wed in return. Meanwhile, the youngsters and maidens engage themselves in collecting wild turmeric, 'Abir' or coloured powder, rice grains, 'Durba ghash' or scutch grass, and marigold. The men take care of the logistics of the upcoming wedding. Once the kheer has been distributed, turmeric has been turned into a fine paste, multiple colours have been unpacked, and the yard has been decorated in the simplest way possible, everyone waits for the main ceremony to unfold.  The bride, the centre of attention, appears looking her best in a bright yellow saree, 'gamcha' or traditional towel in her hand, jewellery made of fresh flowers, glowing in anticipation and happiness. She sits down on a clay stool, or what they call a 'piri', and the games begin! Her face is full of turmeric smudged by everyone, her laughter echoing that of the ones around her. The house soon turns into an absolute mess of giggles, turmeric and colours, with everyone chasing each other to attack them with the remaining paste and powdered colours. As the chasing goes on, elders bathe the bride in milk and water purified with mango leaves, and bless her with rice grains and 'durba', singing folk songs from ancient Bengal. Once the bride has been bathed in beauty and purity, the yard is muddy — this is the cue for the youngsters to drop everyone in the mud.  This is not a ritual only for the brides—the grooms in rural areas also follow this custom before getting married. The only difference is that the son of the house dresses up in a new 'lungi' and 'panjabi', with a new 'gamcha' draped around his shoulder. Rural holud ceremonies include various games and plays like these, which vary from region to region. Some play in the mud, or what is known as 'kada khela', some act in a fun play predicting the bride or groom's future, while others take part in more challenging games, such as locking the soon-to-be-wed in a room! These are usually arranged to momentarily ease the melancholy of the child of the house taking a huge step in life. The day is spent with laughter, tears, adrenaline, and lots of splashes of colour in the form of joy.  As soon as the sun sets beyond the horizon, the bride changes into another yellow saree, and the groom changes into another set of 'kurta pajama'. They sit down for the next ritual to begin. 'Kheer khawano' is a custom celebrated to bless and honour their married life ahead. Elders feed the engaged couple something sweet and give them little presents like money or gold, symbolising a sweet and prosperous life to come. Meanwhile, the maidens and youngsters sing folk songs and dance around, making the environment even more delightful. The night ends with the bride and groom sugar-rushed and happy, everyone else preparing for the next day to unfold, buzzing with hopefulness.  Spectating this occasion is an experience one must have. It fills the heart with love and bags of memories to take home. It does not require all the glam and sparkles for the house to beam with merriness, or for the wedding to be celebrated with equal purity and grace. It does not matter if the summer heat is scorching or the gloom of the bride's departure hangs in the air — the joy, the purity, the absolute scatter of colours, and the glee are all the same. These holud ceremonies celebrate the future of the husband- or wife-to-be, and the core of Bengali culture and nearly extinct rituals in one joyful occasion.","Tue Apr 15, 2025 02:00 PM         Last update on: Tue Apr 15, 2025 04:23 PM"

And while this timeless combo still holds a special place in our hearts (and wardrobes), recent years have seen a delightful shift. The Bengali New Year is slowly shedding its monochrome uniform and embracing a new canvas of colours, prints, and playful styling. This year, we say: keep the spirit, ditch the cliché. Let's go beyond red and white. If there's one colour combination giving red and white a serious run for its money, it is white and magenta. The vibrancy of magenta brings in just the right amount of boldness without overwhelming the calmness of white. From handloom saris with magenta thread work to plain kameezes with printed or embroidered magenta dupattas that flow like summer breeze, this pairing is fast becoming a crowd favourite, and for good reason! It is festive, fresh, and oh-so-flattering. Who would've thought that the old-school charm of polka dots would become a Pahela Baishakh staple? But here we are; living and loving it. Polka dots bring an instant burst of fun to any outfit. Whether it's a retro sari with oversized dots or a breezy kameez with tiny scattered ones, this peppy pattern adds movement, mischief, and a whole lot of personality. Bonus points if you pair it with chunky earrings and a messy bun. Yellow is a classic for a reason — it is bright, sunny, and it practically radiates joy. Pair it with teal, and you've got a combination that's equal parts cool and warm. Think teal kameez with yellow embroidery, or a mustard saree with teal blouse and accessories. It's perfect for that brunch-to-evening dinner transition. While bold colours are making a statement, pastels and soft florals aren't far behind. Blush pinks, powder blues, and mint greens are showing up in cotton and muslin sarees, often paired with quirky blouses or contrasting accessories. Digital prints, hand-painted florals, and abstract motifs are also finding fans among those who prefer subtle elegance over loud hues. Gone are the days of rigid outfit rules. Mix and match is the way to go. Team your traditional saree with a crop top or a denim jacket, or your kameez over contrasting trousers to create your statement co-ord. Play with accessories — beads, silver jhumkas, glass bangles, or just a statement bag. The idea is to reflect the energy of the new year in your own way. Pahela Baishakh has always been about the celebration of culture, of colour, and of community. And what better way to do that than by dressing in outfits that make you feel festive, fearless, and fabulous? Whether you're stepping out for a party, or lounging at a home dawat, this year, let your outfit be as joyful, vibrant, and diverse as the day itself.","Sun Apr 13, 2025 09:16 PM         Last update on: Sun Apr 13, 2025 09:21 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/discover-the-artists-bringing-awe-dhakas-streets-3870551","Discover the artists bringing awe to Dhaka’s streets ","Finding time to visit art galleries and exhibitions often feels like a luxury we cannot afford in this city of ours. But what if art finds you on your way to the office, or on morning walks? Yes, there are some artists in Dhaka whose creations are not confined within the walls of a gallery — they breathe in the open. These hidden visionaries and performers have turned our pavements into canvases and street corners into galleries. It's subtle yet subversive, an unassuming revolution in broad daylight! Today, let's dive into their stories. The very first person we start with is Nazir Hossain, better known as 'Tiger Nazir.' He is a self-taught potua, or scroll painter. He earned the name by painting tigers in scroll art. You will spot him outside Charukala, near the National Museum in Shahbagh. With brushes in hand and a canvas covered with paint, he, himself, appears to be a live canvas. You may even be fortunate enough to see his fresh paintings hanging from a rope if you happen to go there at the perfect time. Whatever, whenever, speaks to Nazir's spirit; he paints it with a touch of tiger in it. Nazir's talent gained international recognition in 2015 when his powerful and graceful artwork, Bantora Kun, was chosen as the mascot for Bangladesh-Japan business circles. He first displayed his scroll paintings at ChobirHaat, an open-air art gallery near Dhaka University. Nazir also contributed to a novel, Tuki the Tiger by Alexis Krasilovsky and Shameem Akhtar, with his colourful and lively illustrations. Despite his achievements, Hossain remains grounded, always carrying our national flag tied around his forehead. When asked about his inspiration, Nazir Hossain simply states, ""It was my mother's nakshi kantha that brought me here. The patterns she stitched, the stories she told with her needle, still inspire my art."" Hossain prefers to paint on the streets, not for lack of opportunity, but for a sense of purpose. ""The streets keep me connected to people,"" he says. ""Art isn't just about galleries; it's about reaching those who might never step into one. It's about making them pause, reflect, and feel something."" A few steps away from Nazir Hossain, you'll find Md Lal Mea outside Charukala, a bongshibajok (flute maestro) who has been crafting and playing his beloved flutes for nearly 40 years. You will see him playing his flute while waiting for curious passers-by to stop and admire his work. Seeing him then and there playing his flute, I could not resist striking up a conversation. But before I could finish, he totally cut me off with a surprising question, ""Is this the first time you've noticed me here?"" And the answer from my side was a simple ""Yes,"" but his response left me speechless — ""You've been studying here for more than five years, yet you never noticed me. See? That's the life of a street artist in this country; a few admirers and our passion are all that keep us going."" Lal Mea's words put me in guilt. He made me think of a family I used to see at Rabindra Shorobor — a father and daughter duo singing soulful Bhatiyali songs, drawing a small crowd with their heartfelt performances. But they're no longer there. Perhaps they, too, were casualties of the unrelenting battle for survival on Dhaka streets. There's another dedicated soul — Mohammad Hiru, the bioscope-wala in a clown costume. Although he ditches the costume in summer, you will always spot him with his colourful hat that never fails to draw attention. Hiru usually sets up after 5 PM near Anam Rangs Plaza at 6/A Satmasjid Road, Dhanmondi, where he showcases his handcrafted bioscope with pride. He sings songs of all kinds when you peer into the tiny holes of his bioscope. ""This bioscope is my dream box,"" says Hiru bhai, every time I ask him about it. ""I have made my own bioscope from scratch, with no master to guide me,"" he shares. ""The first time I saw one at a village fair in Bogra, I just knew I had to create my own. I was a kid back then. But now, here I am, living that dream."" Though Hiru Bhai, too, faced his fair share of consequences while following his dream on the streets. Yet his passion keeps him going. To me, Mohammad Hiru is a living reminder of the beauty and persistence of street art. What fills my heart is seeing him standing as a beacon of resilience against all odds. Now, let's talk about a part-time street artist, Md Fazar Ali, studying graphic design at the University of Dhaka. He is often seen with his canvas and brushes, capturing the world around him through his strokes. Whether at the Central Shaheed Minar or Kamalapur Railway Station, you will see him creating portraits and sketches. But there are drawbacks to Fazar's love of art as well. ""The lack of interest I encounter from others can be disheartening at times,"" he says. ""I was once insulted by a customer when I brought up the cost of a hand-drawn sketch. According to him, printing a high-resolution photo would be better and less expensive than my sketch."" Fazar's words sheds light on the often-overlooked struggles of artists who put their all into their work, only to face a lack of recognition for the value of their work. What I realised after talking to all of them is that art isn't really accepted here, let alone appreciated! And when it's on the street, it is seen as something unnecessary, even frivolous. However, people like Lal Mea, Hiru Bhai, or Tiger Nazir are still there. Being the stubborn gatekeeper of their passion and our culture! So next time you hear the soft strains of a flute or catch a glimpse of a colourful scroll, stop for a moment. Listen. See. Because behind every note and brushstroke is a story of resilience here.","Sun Apr 13, 2025 09:09 PM         Last update on: Sun Apr 13, 2025 09:16 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/rashid-choudhury-weaving-magic-bangladeshs-art-scene-3870541","Rashid Choudhury: Weaving magic into Bangladesh’s art scene","""I did not feel satisfied with the usual oils and watercolours. As piano and organ are excellent musical instruments but not much effective for solo performances, there are typical mediums in the field of art which have their limitations… I was, therefore, looking for a medium through which, I can fittingly depict men and nature of my motherland. My search has borne fruit at last, I found my destination in tapestry."" One of the oldest forms of textile art, it has been used to create objects we see in our everyday lives, from dresses to purses and table covers, as well as some of the most beautiful artworks. Tapestry as an art form flourished in medieval Europe, and was introduced here at the hands of artist Rashid Choudhury in the 1960s. One of the most renowned exponents of modern art, Rashid Choudhury took it upon himself to venture into uncharted territory. It demanded time, technique, and tremendous dedication — particularly in a place where the form was virtually unknown. He committed himself fully, pioneering a genre and creating monumental works that today stand as cultural landmarks. And he did so with style and finesse, creating signature pieces that undeniably cry out ""Rashid Choudhury.""   Traditionally, large tapestries added vibrant colours to any space; they were both functional and provided food for thought through their dramatic depiction of Biblical stories, mythology, and the classics, or just mere portrayals of people's lives. They were, and still are, costly and time-consuming to produce, and perfect for showing off the owner's opulence and fine taste! Born into an aristocratic family in rural Bengal, it is hardly a surprise that Choudhury was influenced by the various religions and cultures of the land. He enrolled in the Government Art Institute of Dhaka, where he started as a painter, honing his skills in more traditional forms like watercolours and oils. However, Choudhury would soon immerse himself in the avant-garde art movements of the time. Like most of his peers, he developed a keen appreciation for abstract art. And, rather than simply following the Western styles, he sought to merge the spirit of indigenous forms of Bengal with European techniques. Under the guidance of French artist Jean Lurçat — ""the father of modern tapestry"" — Choudhury settled on the medium he is most known for today. Some of his creations are visual narratives while others are far more abstract, evoking emotion and rhythm through form and texture. His tapestries often carry figurative elements like stylised human forms recalling folk or mythological figures. His use of colours is a reference to the strong, earthy palettes that evoke the landscapes and moods of this region. Rashid Choudhury made abundant use of themes drawing from Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic traditions — expressing ethos true to our pluralistic heritage. His tapestries are large, mural-like pieces, and some of his best-known works adorn government buildings, universities, and cultural centres in Dhaka and beyond. These were not just decorative but deeply symbolic, and meant to inspire reflection on our identity, nature, and spirituality. It would not be an exaggeration to say that Choudhury's tapestries helped redefine the boundaries of Bangladeshi art. His influence continues to be felt in the contemporary art scene. As Choudhury himself once said, ""Life finds its autonomy through expression. And death, in silence. That is why, it is through the expression of joy and sorrow that we are truly alive. And we attain immortality through our actions.""   Photo: Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation (DBF)

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/mangal-shobhajatra-renamed-return-roots-3869551","Mangal Shobhajatra renamed: A return to roots?","So, it's official. The iconic Mangal Shobhajatra — that colourful, larger-than-life procession we all know and love on Pahela Baishakh — is no longer called Mangal Shobhajatra. The name has been changed. Say hello to Barshabaran Ananda Shobhajatra — a brand-new old name. Yes! The very first parade in 1989 was called Ananda Shobhajatra, meaning a joyful procession. It was only in 1996, after democracy was restored in Bangladesh, that ""Mangal"" was added, infusing the event with a deeper socio-political message. So technically, the Faculty of Fine Arts at Dhaka University isn't creating a new name — they're hitting rewind. Maybe you remember the wave of online debates from earlier, when filmmaker and Cultural Affairs Adviser, Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, casually suggested that the name could change. Back then, it felt like just another 'maybe.' But now, it's real. Renaming traditions is not new, be it in Bangladesh or anywhere else in the world. But why does it matter? It's just a name, right? Well, not exactly. In semiotics, a name carries more meaning than it might seem. It's a symbol. It carries emotion, memory, and history. And when you change a name, you reshape how people connect with it. The difference is subtle but symbolic. Mangal Shobhajatra wasn't just a pretty name. ""Mangal"" means auspicious, hopeful, a kind of collective prayer for a better future. When Dhaka University's Faculty of Fine Arts launched the procession in 1989, it wasn't just about art or fun. It was a statement — born during a politically turbulent time, it carried the spirit of resistance and renewal. Now, Barshabaran Ananda Shobhajatra brings us back to the name's earliest roots. A joyful procession. So, in some ways, this isn't a departure, but a return. A reset. But still, it feels different. And when you swap out 'Mangal' for 'Ananda,' you're telling a different story. One isn't necessarily better than the other — but they are different. That's the beauty, and the burden of semiotics. It makes us look twice. If you think cultural traditions should evolve with the times, then this might feel like a positive, refreshing move. It opens up the celebration to be just that — a celebration. If you're more rooted in the symbolic power of history, then the shift might feel like something meaningful has been lost. Like softening a bold statement into a general one. In the end, both perspectives make sense. One of the big concerns is what this change means for UNESCO recognition. In 2016, Mangal Shobhajatra was listed as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The name was part of the identity that earned it global recognition. So naturally, people are wondering: If we change the name, do we risk changing how the world sees it? Or how do we explain it? Officially, nothing's been said about losing that status. But the question hangs there, quietly. This 14 April, the streets will fill with celebration once more. People of all ages will join this Barshabaran Ananda Shobhajatra, wearing laal-pere shada sarees and panjabis — carrying painted masks, handcrafted birds, and vibrant motifs held high in the air. Music will flow through the air, laughter will rise above the crowd, and the spirit of Pahela Baishakh will once again light up the heart of Bangladesh. The name has changed. But the energy, the community, the artistry — that's still very much alive. Still, it's okay to pause for a moment and ask: When we change a name, what else changes with it? Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Only time will tell.","Sat Apr 12, 2025 03:12 PM         Last update on: Sat Apr 12, 2025 03:20 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/pahela-baishakh-origins-and-celebrations-3869541","Pahela Baishakh: Origins and celebrations ","Pahela Baishakh is the celebration of Bengali New Year. The name itself means First of Baishakh, the first month of the Bengali calendar. Pahela Baishakh now falls on the 14 of April of the Georgian calendar, and it is a day of joyous celebration in Bangladesh. But surely, you have wondered about its history and when or why did it all start? It is believed that it was Mughal Emperor Akbar who facilitated the Bangla calendar or Bangabda. The emperor's initiative was financial, rather than cultural. Back in those days, agriculture was the main source of taxes, and was collected according to the Hijri calendar. The Hijri calendar, for those not in the know, is a lunar calendar, and was not in sync with crop seasons. This caused quite an issue, and the emperor took it upon himself to find a solution. Upon his commission, Fatehullah Shirazi formulated a new calendar by aligning the Islamic calendar with the harvest season and thus, solving the issue. That's how Bangabda came into being, and we got our Pahela Baishakh as the first day of the year. The new calendar, introduced on 10 or 11 March, 1584, was initially known as Tarikh-e-Elahi. Some debate that it was King Shashanka of Gaur (Gauda) who brought about the bangabda (Bengali calendar). However, historians lean towards Emperor Akbar as the patron for Bangla calendar. Before Pahela Baishakh became such a culturally recognised celebration, it was celebrated with the opening of new halkhata. It has survived the test of time, and still can be spotted in the shops and businesses in many areas. Once upon a time, zamindars did the same. Festive decorations go hand in hand with halkhata in the form of confetti, flowers, and colourful designs. And of course — sweetmeats. The Baishakhi celebration essentially kicks off with a cultural programme hosted by Chhayanaut, a cultural organisation established in 1961. Chhayanaut's first Nababarsha celebration began at the altar of the huge bot (banyan) tree, which is actually an ashwattha tree, but the place is well known by the mellifluous name — 'Ramna-r Botomul.' There are also colourful processions, not just in Dhaka but also all across the country. And a major part of Baishakhi celebration has to do with foods. Sweetmeats are distributed, both for opening new halkhatas, and to welcome the new year. Red and white colours are seen in plenty, along with yellow to match the festivity. Panjabi and saree are of particular interest, and shopping prior to Pahela Baishakh has also caught on, which tells you a lot about the festivity and celebration, and how passionately people celebrate Pahela Baishakh. As uncomfortable as an April day can be in Bangladesh, it does not put a dent in the celebration of Pahela Baishakh. Not only do people don fashionably colourful dresses, but they also go out, have fun, and enjoy a good meal with friends and family.","Sat Apr 12, 2025 02:54 PM         Last update on: Sat Apr 12, 2025 03:12 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/lifehacks/news/7-simple-tricks-keep-your-home-cool-and-chic-summer-3868181","7 simple tricks to keep your home cool and chic this summer","The mercury is rising, and the fans are whirring away at full speed — yes, summer has made its grand entrance in Bangladesh. While we're busy swapping out our wardrobes for lighter clothes and relying on the AC to survive the heat, why not show the same love to our living spaces? With just a few thoughtful tweaks, you can turn your home into a cool, calm sanctuary — one that doesn't just look refreshing but feels it, too. Here are 7 simple yet stylish home décor ideas to keep your space summer-ready! Your bed deserves a summer makeover, too! Use light cotton sheets, and avoid polyester blends that trap sweat. Choose cool-toned pillowcases and bedspreads to psychologically soothe the senses. Bonus tip? Keep a spritz bottle of rose water in the fridge and spray your linens lightly before bedtime. Sometimes, furniture blocks the natural flow of air. Reposition sofas or shelves away from windows and doorways to allow cross-ventilation. Keep doors open during cooler hours of the day (especially early morning or late evening) to let the breeze pass through. Place mirrors near windows to reflect light and brighten darker corners without using extra lamps or lights. Bonus: hang a wet gamcha or a fine cotton cloth in front of the window — it cools incoming air as the breeze passes through. Many Bangladeshi homes still have a small veranda or balcony — don't let it go unused! Place moist clay pots, potted tulshi or neem plants, and wet jute mats to naturally reduce temperature. Add a cane chair to create a breezy corner for tea and chitchat. Pro tip: sprinkle water on the floor in the evening for a cool-down effect — it works like natural air conditioning! Bulky incandescent lights emit heat. Swap them out for LED bulbs, which are energy-efficient and cooler. You can also use fairy lights or battery-powered lanterns to create a soft, ambient mood without the heat output. Roll away those thick rugs! Replace them with cotton dhurries, handloom mats, or bamboo chatai. These traditional floor coverings don't trap heat and can be easily cleaned. A bonus? They give your home a rustic-chic look that's very in-trend. Colour doesn't just change how a room looks — it influences how it feels, especially during those scorching Bangladeshi summers. Swapping out your usual colour palette for cooler, lighter shades can make your space feel instantly more breathable and calmer. Think aqua blues, minty greens, sky greys, lemon yellows, and soft lilacs — these colours naturally reflect more light, making rooms feel more open and less stuffy. Here's a quirky hack: freeze flower petals, mint leaves, or rose water in ice trays and use them in shallow bowls across your home. As the ice melts slowly, it releases cooling scents into the air. Position them near windows or fans for a naturally fragrant and refreshing breeze. Staying cool during summer doesn't have to mean hiding indoors with the AC on full blast.

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/food-recipes/news/wise-ghats-watermelon-rush-feast-the-eyes-and-palate-3868161","Wise Ghat's watermelon rush: A feast for the eyes and palate","If you've been to Wise Ghat very recently, you'll be familiar with the scene of watermelons being unloaded from boats. With summer here, watermelons have arrived at the perfect time. Now that the markets are overflowing with fresh watermelons, it's the best time to enjoy this refreshing fruit after a long day out! The sight of fresh, vibrant watermelons piled high on boats and nearby stalls create a beautiful contrast against the bustling streets of Old Dhaka. The markets are alive with the colours of summer. It was around 2 PM when labourers were unloading watermelons from boats. Some were still working under the hot sun, while others took a break after hours of hard labour. We approached Md Nesar, a labourer, resting under the shade, to learn more about their contribution. ""We are labourers, and we unload watermelons using bamboo baskets. For each watermelon, we earn Tk 3 to Tk 3.5. We carry them in batches of 8 to 10 and unload them at the nearby stores,"" Nesar shares. When asked about the supply this year, he shares, ""There are only a few boats now, as you can see here, but soon, the number of boats will increase, and so will the watermelons."" But it's not just watermelons that arrive at the riverbank. ""Fruits like lychees, pineapples, guavas, dragon fruits, papayas, and mangoes also arrive by boats. We work all year round, not just during watermelon season,"" explains Limon, another labourer. We found Hasib, the Sardar — someone who arranges labourers for unloading fruits, giving orders to his men to work properly. He himself started as a labourer, and has been in the Sardar profession for nearly 8 years. His family has been in the business for about 40 years, starting with his grandfather. You might wonder how watermelons are distributed fairly, when they come in different sizes. According to their terminology, there are four size categories, each priced differently. The largest is called 'Mati,' followed by 'Majhla,' 'Tin Number,' and the smallest, 'Kat.' ""To keep things simple, they are often referred to as sizes 1, 2, 3 and 4. There is a designated man on the boat whose job is to ensure the watermelons are distributed properly,"" Hasib explains. When asked how they keep track of the number of watermelons each labourer unloads, Hasib describes, ""There's a simple system. Every time a labourer carries watermelons from the boat, the person assigned hands him a stick with signs sealed on it. The sticks help keep count of how many watermelons he has unloaded."" So, where do all the watermelons come from? The watermelons come from Rangabali, locally known as the capital of watermelons, as well as from Galachipa, Char Fasson, and Bhola. They travel in large boats from Barishal, Bhola, or Patuakhali, and are unloaded at Wise Ghat, Hajiganj, or Fatullah before the Asr prayer call. Some watermelons also arrive by truck and are distributed to different wholesale markets across the city. ""There are other wholesale watermelon markets apart from the one here. Karwan Bazar, Hajiganj, and Jatrabari also have their wholesale markets,"" shares Hasib. Sardar Hasib also introduced us to deeper insights into how this trade operates. Though the process may seem simple, it involves people with multiple responsibilities. There are two main roles: 'Byapari' and 'Aratdar.' The Aratdar is a wholesaler who provides loans to the Byapari. The Byapari then manages the entire watermelon cultivation process and sells the produce with a commission. ""This means that a single watermelon supports the livelihoods of farmers, byaparis, aratdars, sardars, labourers and many others,"" Hasib explains. The wholesale market, standing on the other side of the road from Wise Ghat, is known as Alf Sani (R.A) Market, located at 7 Ahsan Ullah Road. From here, watermelon supplies spread across the entire city. Jitu, an Aratdar, explains, ""We sell in bulk — either per 100 or per 150 watermelons, depending on the production. It can start from Tk 20 and go up to Tk 300 or more per piece."" The watermelon season lasts for almost four months. During this time, thousands of people work hard to ensure that fresh watermelons reach markets and consumers. The trade is more than just buying and selling — it is a long-standing tradition that supports many families. As the season continues, the river will get busier, boats will bring in more loads — this is the only hope of all the people involved.","Thu Apr 10, 2025 04:29 PM         Last update on: Thu Apr 10, 2025 04:40 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/purny-ayman-bangladeshs-first-female-racer-international-circuit-3867306","Purny Ayman: Bangladesh’s first female racer on an international circuit","When Purny Ayman crossed the finish line at the Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi, she wasn't just completing a race — she was making history. As the first Bangladeshi woman to compete in an international motorsport event, Ayman's participation in the UAE Time Attack wasn't just about speed or rankings. It was about representation, perseverance, and breaking barriers in a field where Bangladeshi women have rarely been seen, let alone celebrated. Competing in the rear-wheel drive unlimited class, Ayman drove a Toyota GT 86 and finished fourth — an impressive feat. There were 35 cars racing 5 different classes, including higher-performance Porsche and BMW cars. Her focus wasn't on outpacing others. It was on proving that women from Bangladesh belong in global motorsports just as much as anyone else. Ayman's interest in cars began long before she had the chance to sit behind a race car's wheel. ""Ever since I was a child, cars fascinated me,"" she said. ""My father used to change models frequently, and I was always curious. Over time, it became more than a hobby — it's a lifelong passion that fuels my excitement every single day."" This early curiosity matured into a serious ambition. What was once casual interest turned into late-night research, hands-on practice, and eventually, competitive driving. But growing up in a country with virtually no motorsport infrastructure, especially for women, made her journey far from easy. A key influence on Ayman's racing journey was Avik Anwar, a well-known figure in Bangladesh's automotive scene. ""He used to watch me drive and always encouraged me,"" she recalled. ""He'd say things like, 'Your handling is great. You should take this seriously.' That meant a lot to me. It pushed me to think beyond just driving for fun."" With this motivation, Ayman initially planned to train in India. ""We were looking into proper training programs abroad. I even bought my first simulator thinking that I'd get to train physically too,"" she explained. But just as plans began to take shape, COVID-19 disrupted everything. Travel restrictions forced her to stay home and rethink her approach. Rather than give up, Ayman doubled down. In late 2024, she invested in a new simulator and began racing in online competitions organised by the Automobile Association of Bangladesh (AAB). ""That phase was crucial. It helped me build reflexes, understand race dynamics, and stay sharp,"" she said. Her skills began to show as she performed well in virtual races, even winning a few. Ahead of her UAE debut, Ayman also underwent hands-on training at both the Dubai Autodrome and Yas Marina F1 Circuit. ""I had a few sessions with a trainer there — it helped me adjust from virtual to real-world racing,"" she said. For Ayman, this milestone isn't just a personal win. ""It's more than just my achievement,"" she said. ""This is about breaking barriers and showing other women that it's possible to pursue what you love — even if it's in a field dominated by men."" She acknowledges that women drivers often face scepticism. ""People judge you just for being on the road, let alone on a track,"" she noted. ""But if you let that negativity get to you, nothing will ever happen. If someone has a dream like this, they should go for it — no matter what others say."" When asked about how different places compare in supporting women in motorsports, Ayman shared a nuanced view. ""Dubai is very open-minded and inclusive,"" she said. ""But honestly, maybe people there just don't have the same deep passion to pursue it seriously. In Europe, though, it's different — you see many female drivers, and it's much more normalised."" Her long-term goal? To keep racing and help develop a motorsports culture in Bangladesh —especially for women. Purny Ayman's debut on an international track is more than a headline. It's a moment of change — subtle but significant — for how Bangladeshi women are seen in the world of motorsports. Her success came through preparation, resilience, and belief in her ability. But she's quick to remind us: she doesn't want to be the only one. ""I just hope more women come forward,"" she concluded, adding, ""This is just the beginning.""   Photo: Courtesy

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/food-recipes/news/would-you-pay-tk-8-lakh-scoop-ice-cream-3867296","Would you pay Tk 8 lakh for a scoop of ice cream?","Imagine a dessert so luxurious that it costs more than a round-trip flight to Europe. That's exactly what Japanese brand Cellato has created with its record-breaking ice cream flavour, ""Byakuya"" — now officially recognised by Guinness World Records as the most expensive ice cream in the world. Priced at a jaw-dropping ¥873,400 (approximately $6,696 or Tk 8,07,058) per serving, Byakuya is not just a treat for the taste buds — it's a masterpiece for the most elite of palates. At the heart of Byakuya lies the white truffle from Alba, Italy — a gourmet treasure known as the ""diamond of the kitchen."" Sourced in limited quantities and sold for up to $15,192 per kilogram, this aromatic delicacy gives the gelato an earthy depth and pungent sophistication. But Cellato didn't stop there. The dessert also includes Parmigiano Reggiano, the king of Italian cheese, for a savoury kick that balances the sweetness. And Sake lees, a creamy by-product of Japanese sake-making, add a velvety texture and an umami undertone. To top off this ultra-luxurious experience, a few drops of white truffle oil are added before serving, intensifying the already complex flavour profile. Some versions even feature a delicate dusting of edible gold leaf, just in case it wasn't extravagant enough. Creating Byakuya wasn't an overnight venture. Cellato spent over 1.5 years perfecting the flavour and presentation, working closely with Chef Tadayoshi Yamada of Osaka's fine-dining fusion restaurant RiVi. Yamada, known for his imaginative takes on Japanese and Western cuisine, was an ideal partner to bring this daring East-meets-West dessert to life. The development involved countless rounds of tasting and fine-tuning to strike the perfect balance between the rich, creamy base and the bold, distinctive ingredients. The result is a dessert that's both decadent and deeply nuanced — and one that redefines what a scoop of ice cream can be. Part of what makes Byakuya so exclusive is the presentation. Each serving comes with a handcrafted metal spoon made in Kyoto's Fushimi district, known for its centuries-old artisanal traditions. The spoon itself is a collector's item, crafted using techniques used in the construction of Japanese temples and shrines. To enjoy Byakuya at its best, Cellato recommends a ritual: let the ice cream soften at room temperature or warm slightly in the microwave for 10-20 seconds. Then, drizzle the white truffle oil and stir gently to release the full bouquet of aromas before your first bite. While Byakuya is the crown jewel, Cellato isn't stopping there. The brand continues to innovate with flavours like ""Starry Night"" — a combination of black truffle, dark chocolate, and yuzu citrus, offered at a (relatively) more affordable ¥10,000 ($72). With Byakuya, Cellato hasn't just made ice cream — they've created an experience. A fusion of culinary traditions, luxury ingredients, and artistic craftsmanship, this is ice cream for those who believe that dessert should never be ordinary.","Wed Apr 9, 2025 04:53 PM         Last update on: Wed Apr 9, 2025 05:01 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/boycotts-or-backlash-the-fine-line-between-protest-and-vandalism-3866391","Boycotts or backlash? The fine line between protest and vandalism","The streets of Bangladesh have once again echoed with chants for justice — this time, in solidarity with Palestine. As images of bombed hospitals and lifeless children pour in from Gaza, the anger here is real, raw, and deeply human. Our people, known for their empathy and resilience, are standing up. But in that fury, some lines are being crossed — and the consequences may be more damaging than empowering. Recently, groups of protesters, enraged by the ongoing Israeli assault, took their frustrations out on local outlets of foreign brands, vandalising properties they associate with Western complicity. These acts were carried out in the name of Palestine. But the truth is far more complicated — and far more tragic. Because when glass shatters on a local shop floor in Dhaka or Sylhet, it's not Tel Aviv that feels the tremor. It's the Bangladeshi workers cleaning up the mess. It's the local staff — our brothers, sisters, students — who depend on those jobs. These shops aren't foreign embassies or arms manufacturers. They're often franchises run by Bangladeshis, staffed by Bangladeshis, serving Bangladeshis. Solidarity with Palestine is not only justified — it's urgent. The crisis in Gaza is a human catastrophe, and silence is complicity. You want to do something. Shout, march, boycott, rage. Totally valid. Rage is sometimes the only sane response. But… whose bright idea was it to take that anger out on a random store in your own neighbourhood? Seriously, who started this ""break windows = save Palestine"" trend? What does breaking a glass door achieve? Does it end apartheid? Or does it just turn into another viral video that makes the movement look bad, loses public support, and gives the other side an easy headline? We have every right to be furious. But rage without strategy is just noise. It burns quickly — and often, it burns the wrong things. You want to boycott? Great. Stop buying products from companies with real, traceable ties to harmful policies. Want to make noise? Perfect. Join rallies, chant your heart out, make the streets echo. Want to support Palestine? Beautiful. Donate. Share verified news. Write. Educate. But when you start throwing rocks at a glass door or torching a food court — you're not helping Palestine. You're just giving the other side a great excuse to say, ""See? They're violent."" History has shown us the power of strategic resistance. From the Salt March in India to the Montgomery Bus Boycott in the U.S., protest movements succeeded not because they were loud, but because they were smart. They disrupted systems, not storefronts. They built networks, not fear. They changed the world not by breaking things, but by breaking systems. In Bangladesh, we have our own examples of strategic resistance that reshaped history. The Language Movement of 1952 stands as a powerful example. When students in Dhaka stood up for their right to speak Bengali, their non-violent resistance led to widespread support and, ultimately, the recognition of Bangla as one of the state languages of Pakistan. Similarly, during the Liberation War of 1971, the fight for independence wasn't just about loud protests, but about organised resistance, building alliances, and strategically dismantling an oppressive system. These movements didn't succeed through mindless violence; they succeeded because they were focused, well-planned, and rooted in a clear sense of justice. In Bangladesh, we have a powerful platform for global solidarity. But we need to sharpen that power. Boycotts can work — but only when targeted, sustained, and grounded in economic analysis. Marches can matter — but only when they elevate the cause, not undermine it. The enemy is a brutal war machine built on oppression, not a local sales counter managed by a 22-year-old student trying to pay for tuition. If we truly care about justice, we must protest in ways that build justice — not destroy livelihoods. Anger is valid. But strategy is powerful.","Tue Apr 8, 2025 03:40 PM         Last update on: Tue Apr 8, 2025 03:44 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/stand-comedy-how-laughter-became-dhakas-favourite-therapy-3866311","Stand-up comedy: How laughter became Dhaka’s favourite therapy","From the witty exchanges of Bengali folk songs and the satirical undertones of theatrical productions to the cheeky punchlines of television dramas, laughter has been an essential part of our culture and a popular outlet for connection and commentary. However, the concept of stand-up comedy, an individual armed with a microphone and delivering witty and observational humour to a live audience, has been a foreign notion until relatively recently. Over the years, the scene, especially in urban areas like Dhaka, has transformed into the new go-to for entertainment from an obscure idea. So, it is natural for one to wonder how this transformation happened. What made people acknowledge stand-up comedy as a budding art form? The answers lie in the stories of its pioneers and the societal shifts that have shaped its growing popularity. Ferdous Utsho, an employee at a digital marketing agency, regularly attends shows with his friends to unwind after a hectic workweek. ""On Thursday nights, we gather at a comedy show to catch up and laugh together. It has become our way of escaping the daily grind and starting the weekend on a positive note,"" he shares. You tell people you're starting a comedy club. What would be their first reaction? Perhaps laughter…but not the good kind! That's exactly what Naveed Mahbub, one of the pioneers in Bangladesh, faced when he launched Naveed's Comedy Club (NCC), where he now remains as its CEO. According to Mahbub, the story began during the early 2010s — a time when the concept was barely understood. He elaborates, ""When we started the Club back in 2010, the biggest challenge was finding performers. We didn't have many comedians at the time, and to organise regular shows, we needed a consistent line-up."" In the beginning, shows were sporadic, poorly attended, and often misunderstood by the majority. Sadly, artistes who emerged during this time leaned heavily toward slapstick or theatrical humour and borrowed inspiration from Western styles. Remembering the initial struggles, Sami Doha, a telecom expert turned celebrated stand-up comedian, says, ""You see, back then, performances were mainly Dhaka-centric, and shows were sporadic. The audience did not quite understand what stand-up comedy was, and performers were few and far between. Everyone considered it to be a hobby and not a profession."" The lack of platforms only contributed to the struggle, as early enthusiasts mostly performed in cafés or as opening acts for bigger events. Nevertheless, the hurdles were there, and so was the determination. According to Naveed Mahbub, the advent of social media platforms in the 2010s was a game-changer for the stand-up comedy scene, with Facebook and YouTube becoming vital tools for performers to share content, reach wider audiences, and establish a presence beyond live shows. ""Digital media, especially social media, has played a central role in spreading the word,"" says Mahbub. ""With comedians sharing reels, shorts, and videos online, it has noticeably boosted awareness and interest in stand-up comedy."" Thanks to this digital revolution, the reach of comedy was not only amplified, but audiences started to become aware of the format. Echoing the same sentiment, Doha shares, ""Truly, social media has been a game-changer for the comedians. Regular reels and videos rack up hundreds of thousands of views, helping us build fan bases far beyond Dhaka. On top of that, stand-up specials on OTT platforms have also brought Bangladeshi comedy to new heights."" With time, open mics became more frequent, and stand-up comedians gained visibility. Now, there are organisations like Naveed's Comedy Club (NCC) and Standup Dhaka that dedicatedly nurture new talents. The popularity and support those performers have received have paved the way for a growing talent pool, making it easier to organise regular shows not only in Dhaka but also in other districts. Today, the scene in Bangladesh has come a long way from its humble beginnings. We now see cities like Dhaka and Chattogram hosting regular events, ranging from intimate open mics to large-scale performances. Moreover, shows are performed weekly and in our native language, which has made stand-up comedy more relatable to wider audiences and created a thriving community of enthusiasts. Dhaka has become the epicentre of this cultural shift, as Doha details, ""The city boasts multiple shows, thanks to relentless efforts from dedicated venues and organisers."" He highlights how the frequency of these events has fostered a sense of community among comedians and allowed audiences to develop a deeper appreciation for stand-up comedy as an art form. Comedians now focus on everyday themes that the audience can connect with, from the chaos of Dhaka's traffic to quirky family dynamics and the absurdities of bureaucracy and politics. These topics are mostly delivered in the audience's native language, which has further increased its popularity. ""I would say it is both a challenge and a thrill when it comes to tailoring jokes that cater to a diverse Bangladeshi audience,"" says Doha. The art lies in addressing shared experiences while respecting cultural sensitivities."" While people elsewhere might delve into edgy or provocative material, Bangladeshi performers often take a more discreet and sober approach, balancing humour with respect for societal norms. Major milestones, such as Shilpakala Academy hosting its first-ever stand-up comedy show in 2024, have further legitimised the art form. The show featured notable performers like Mahedi Hasan Toru, Akhlaq Siddiqi, and Shawon Majumder. Events like these demonstrate that stand-up comedy is no longer confined to niche spaces but is becoming an accepted and celebrated part of Bangladesh's cultural landscape. Moreover, events like the Roast of Salman Muqtadir, which raised funds for flood victims, have demonstrated that Bangladeshi audiences are open to edgier humour, provided it is handled with sensitivity. Another defining feature of today's stand-up scene is how people are experimenting with different styles. You may notice some using observational humour while others rely on self-deprecating humour and light-hearted commentary on societal taboos. This growing diversity is truly commendable and the best part about this is the development of a unique sense of community among comedians and audiences. As the scene continues to expand, its role as both an entertainment medium and a social gathering phenomenon is becoming increasingly important.  This shift highlights the broader cultural impact of stand-up comedy in Bangladesh. It's not just about the jokes — it's about bringing people together and creating moments of joy in a fast-paced world.   Photo: Courtesy; Shadab Shahrokh Hai

"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/dining-room-makeover-warm-post-eid-gatherings-3865916","A dining room makeover for warm post-Eid gatherings","Even after all the vibrant Eid celebrations, your dining room remains an important place to spend time with family or friends. To help you fill your days with food and fun, you might want a room where everyone can sit back, relax, and enjoy conversations. Some subtle changes in your dining room can portray an atmosphere of bliss and relaxation, making sure that the gatherings cherished together as a family become warm and comforting. Lighting plays a crucial role in creating the mood for any room. To create an aura of relaxation in your dining room, choose soft and warm lighting rather than bright overhead light fixtures. Warm-toned pendant lighting or well-placed table lamps would add to the hominess of the room. Some fairy lights or candles in elegant beige holders will shed soft light that enhances the splendour and makes the room feel snug and welcoming for your loved ones. After an appetising Eid dinner, sitting down with comfort is a must. So, you can go for cushy seating with upholstered chairs or a long bench with soft pillows in your dining room. A throw or a table runner in soothing, neutral shades like beige, light grey, or soft pastels would also go a long way in making the room lighter. If the dining room is an open-plan, you may think of creating a cosy corner with comfy chairs and a small sofa, letting family members sit after their meals and be close to each other to converse. Bringing a piece of nature indoors can evoke a sense of tranquillity in your dining area. In fact, a few indoor plants could easily beautify the room while purifying the air. Plants such as peace lilies, ferns, and succulents will present no maintenance challenge to you; they will also synchronise with the dining area's theme. Besides that, a floral table centrepiece would symbolise serenity and still retain a bit of the festive feel post-Eid. A cluttered dining space can sometimes ruin the whole mood you intend to have for the gathering with your friends or family. So, ensure that all unwanted and tangled materials are taken away from the room to give it a cleaner look. You should maintain simple but classy table settings with minimalist cutlery. A fresh, organised space creates a wonderful environment for everyone to relax and soak in the moment, free of distractions. When all the major works are done, get personal with some accents in your dining room. Consider putting up framed memories with family, handmade placemats, or heirloom objects that express your personality. These little things will remind everyone of the close bonds and give your space an even warmer feel. With comfort, simplicity, and warmth in consideration, the dining area then becomes the true heart of your home, long after Eid festivities. However, upgrading your dining room for a relaxing impression might not feel so relaxing for your wallet. Thankfully, the option of EMI is a blessing that you can avail. Whether it is upgrading lighting fixtures, buying a new sofa set, or purchasing decorative items, EMI allows you to buy it without burdening your finances. Moreover, EMIs can also provide access to expensive items that you might not have ever imagined obtaining, all within your budget. In any case, with EMI, you can always create your dream space without any compromise. So, you can now enjoy a nice meal, and this renovation will turn your dining room into a place where everyone can unwind, recharge, and, most importantly, be connected by the memory of such a wonderful gathering!","Mon Apr 7, 2025 11:48 PM         Last update on: Mon Apr 7, 2025 11:55 PM"

In contrast to spring mornings, winter mornings are so hushed and uneventful that one may even question if birds exist in this land at all. At the first sight of a blue jay perched on the backyard fence or a cardinal dancing on a leafless cherry branch, I know that my wait for spring is almost over, for I have learned from past experiences that an increase in bird activity signifies the approach of the beautiful season.  In this part of the world, nature comes alive with an abundance of activity. Everywhere I look, I witness signs of life. I witness new life in the pair of robins that's building a nest outside our bathroom window. In May and June, we will discover blue eggshells in the garden. In spring, I witness life in the adult Eastern gray squirrels which munch on peanuts and bask in the spring sun, the young ones playfully leap from branch to branch.  I am reminded that the time has come to clean the backyard birdbath. With the return of migratory birds and other species that sleep through winter, we see a lot of activity around the house. Feathered friends come searching for food and water in our backyard: mourning doves, blue jays, cardinals, sparrows, and robins are the most frequent visitors, often seen dancing, drinking, and/or bathing in the birdbath.  Joy sweeps through the animal and plant kingdoms as everything in the natural world prepares for the arrival of pretty flowers, longer days, clear skies, and gentle breezes. Like everything else in nature, I also eagerly anticipate the time when the days will be warmer and the beauty of young leaves, vibrant daffodils, and delicate cherry blossoms will light up my world. Spring, though short-lived, is an enchanting season. Every season may bring the same kind of energy and activity in nature, and yet every spring is unique. Springtime's subtleties are only perceived and cherished by those who discover new ways to love the season every year. Every spring is, therefore, the same yet different. ","Mon Apr 7, 2025 11:41 PM         Last update on: Mon Apr 7, 2025 11:48 PM"
"LifeLiving","https://www.thedailystar.net/life-living/news/memes-the-unofficial-voice-bangladeshs-digital-generation-3865906","Memes: The unofficial voice of Bangladesh’s digital generation","What started as a niche form of entertainment, in recent years, has grown into a medium for storytelling, political satire, and everyday connection. Memes now serve as a mirror of society, and as Bangladesh continues to embrace digitalisation, they are now contributing to online conversations and sparking social change. From their origins as simple jokes to their evolution as a medium for critique, activism, and connection, they have become an integral part of our digital culture. They entertain us, reflect our realities, and provide a platform for collective thought and action. In the early 2010s, memes in Bangladesh first gained traction and were prominently influenced by global trends. Rubel Rony, the founder of Memelate — a template library — details how the journey began. ""Back in 2006, Facebook was a different platform — people used it mostly to communicate, share stories, and upload pictures. After 2010, images like the troll and frog faces began creating a buzz, and people started sharing these widely,"" says Rony. According to the popular creator, local content was initially dominated by global templates borrowed from platforms like Reddit and 9GAG. While these made people laugh, they inherently lacked a unique identity. Recognising this gap, he founded Memelate to archive what was created by Bangladeshi 'memers' and empower local artists. ""Platforms like 'Moja Losss' and 'Keu Amare Mairala' were initially very popular among young people. I founded Memelate primarily to promote Bangla templates. It's a repository where users can download prototypes and customise them with their creativity,"" he adds. That said, early works were undoubtedly funny and relatable, but what they essentially lacked was that genuine touch of Bangladeshi context and impactful stories that would have the power to promote societal change. However, we did not have to wait very long! As time progressed, so did creativity and thus came the advent of political satires, through which online activists address more serious issues. By blending wit with metaphorical storytelling to navigate societal and political constraints, activists started to tackle complex topics, particularly politics. Rony compares this creativity to Iranian filmmakers who use metaphors to work around restrictions. ""Despite laws like the Digital Security Act (DSA), our creators came up with witty and humorous content that was metaphorical in nature,"" he elaborates. Still, many popular pages could not escape the restrictions imposed by the previous government, and an example is the closing down of Moja Losss in 2015 on account of circulating political commentaries through memes. Many enthusiasts were saddened by this closure — one of them being Shayak Chowdhury, who was an HSC examination candidate back then. ""Moja Losss dared to humour the government in a satirical manner, which I think was brilliant. Political humour is necessary because you can criticise authority through metaphors. The closure of this page came out as a huge disappointment,"" he remarks. During the July Movement, the power of this form as a tool for mobilisation was particularly evident when thousands of people took to the streets, demanding systemic change. Satirical works — whether on the former prime minister or her other ministers — not only entertained people but also spread information and motivated them to defy the restrictions. ""I saw a noteworthy rise in activity, especially after July 2024. Moreover, the number of downloads on Memelate's website (which I manage) skyrocketed. It shows how they became a tool for spreading awareness and rallying support."" Memes have continued to play a role in keeping the conversation alive even after the protests subsided. So, it would be safe to assume that they have become the unofficial pulse-check of our society that reflects not only humour but also our pent-up frustrations. Now, creators use jokes to roast authority figures, call out inefficiencies and remind people of the need for vigilance. One prominent example would be artist Mehedi Hasan's 'Kopila-Majhi' series, which captures the duality of human thought. ""I chose these characters because they represent the questions and answers we grapple with daily. Kopila asks, and Majhi responds — it's a dialogue that encourages people to reflect on their beliefs and societal norms,"" Hasan explains. Indeed, the 'Kopila-Majhi' series is like watching a philosophical debate unfold at a tea stall! As Hasan mentions, memes help to create a sense of shared understanding by capturing the idiosyncrasies of daily life — whether it's the frustration of load-shedding, the excitement of Eid shopping, or the infamous traffic of Dhaka. Ultimately, they distil these experiences into bite-sized pieces of humour that resonate with everyone. For people like Mehedi Hasan, this relatability, with a dash of humour, is central to the effort they put into their creations.  Hasan elaborates, ""When people engage with my content – sharing, commenting, or adding their thoughts. It helps me understand their pulse. People's feedback inspires my work."" As fun and relatable as they are, creating meaningful and original content is not always a walk in the park. Very frequently, oversaturation in the market leads to recycled ideas and shallow humour, which greatly dilutes the quality of meme culture. Additionally, one still has to navigate a fine line when addressing sensitive topics, especially politics. Hasan acknowledges these challenges, saying, ""The hardest part is staying neutral while addressing relevant topics. My goal is to create content that makes people feel seen and heard without pushing agendas or being divisive."" On being ethical, Rony emphasises, ""Memers need to adhere to ethical boundaries. If you are not conscious and create only for the sake of trends, you can seriously harm someone's reputation. Once something is on the internet, there's no erasing it. That's why we emphasise ethics in workshops and interactions with creators."" As we all know, humour is subjective and what might make you laugh might offend another. Therefore, creators must be mindful of how their content impacts individuals and communities. The future looks bright despite all the challenges that persist. With platforms offering resources for meme creators and an ever-growing audience hungry for relatable content, the culture is poised for continued growth. ""They have become part of our lives. They entertain, inform, and connect us. I believe the future of memes and memers is promising. Humour is an inherited trait for us, as Bengalis, and as long as we have stories to tell, our work will thrive,"" reflects Rony. For Hasan, the importance lies in their ability to inspire change. ""History is often documented in traditional ways, but memes allow us to live history in real-time. They have shown us that art and humour can be powerful tools for expression.""

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/education/news/should-you-consider-pursuing-online-degree-3894601","Should you consider pursuing an online degree?","At present, online degrees are becoming more an attractive option to many students, especially to those looking for flexibility and affordability. While this mode of higher education is still new in Bangladesh, it is slowly drawing attention. Online degrees offer the freedom to study from anywhere, often at a fraction of the cost needed to pursue the same degrees in person from traditional universities. More importantly, they let you gain real-world experience while still in university. We reached out to three students, all of whom have experience in pursuing online degrees, to hear what they have to say about this mode of higher studies. Faizah Lubaba Shristy, who began her online degree in Computer Science at the University of the People, said, ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, most public and private university admission exams in Bangladesh were suspended. Besides, the tuition fees for a Computer Science degree were high, and I did not want to take out a loan that could lead to financial strain. I had good grades and a clear goal to earn a degree that would help me pursue meaningful work or entrepreneurial ventures in Bangladesh."" Sharmin Akter Jany had studied Management at a university in China for two years before the pandemic changed her plans. ""A friend recommended that I consider an online degree. Studying in Bangladesh would have meant starting over and spending another four years at university. In contrast, online education was a more efficient and practical solution for me, as a four-year degree can be completed in as little as two and a half years."" Prasun Bipra, who is attending an online BSc programme in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, said, ""I chose the degree because Data Science, which I wanted to pursue, is not widely available as a major in Bangladesh. Also, it gives me a lot of flexibility to learn at my own pace while maintaining other commitments."" For all three students, affordability and time are major factors as to why they opted for an online degree. Regarding the affordability aspect, Bipra said, ""My degree costs roughly around BDT 4.5 lakh. The fee is paid in instalments, so I do not feel much pressure."" Jany enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, consisting of 40 courses, at the University of the People. ""Each course usually costs around USD 120. There is a USD 60 admission fee, but sometimes it is waived. I was fortunate to receive a full scholarship from the beginning, so I did not have to pay anything at all."" Scholarship support also motivated Shristy to continue her degree. ""We only pay an exam fee and there are no admin or book fees. I received scholarships which covered most of my tuition fees. The total cost of my degree was around BDT 5 lakh, but because of scholarships, I paid around BDT 1 lakh in total for my full degree. Students have the scope to secure 70 to 80 percent scholarships in some online degree programmes if they can write a strong admission essay."" Apart from affordability, the flexibility offered in such online programmes is unparalleled. Traditional in-person classes see students spending hours commuting to and from their universities. For those pursuing a degree abroad, the logistics are even more difficult – from relocating to a different country to adjusting to the culture there. Besides, in-person classes also restrict students from attending to other activities, including part-time work. The flexibility of online education, however, eliminates most, if not all, of these problems. As the classes can be attended from anywhere remotely, the need to commute, relocate, or sacrifice part-time work opportunities is no longer necessary. Besides, as Shristy points out, students are granted free access to various premium tools and resources that help them with their courses as well as academics in general. The faculty members' diversity in these online programmes also add value to the studies. ""Our faculty members come from around the globe like India, the US, Africa, the Middle East, and so on. As our university is accredited by WASC – the same prestigious body that accredits Stanford – the standards are world-class,"" said Shristy. Adding to this, Sharmin said, ""The teachers are very supportive. If I ever receive lower marks, I can talk to them and they will look into the matter fairly. We also have a personal programme advisor who responds to our queries within one to two days."" An online degree does not mean the academic standards are any lower. Apart from being accredited by various councils and institutions, the faculty members at these programmes maintain integrity and stick to certain standards. ""Teachers mark according to detailed rubrics, and any shortcuts, like using AI incorrectly, can result in academic misconduct. Everything has to follow proper APA citation rules, and only scholarly, reputable references are accepted,"" said Shristy. All that being said, online learning comes with its own challenges. ""Staying motivated while studying online takes a personal commitment to excellence,"" said Shristy. ""I know deadlines are coming, and with no room for extensions, I have to approach my work with dedication and perfection. There's no second chance – if you miss a week, you fall behind."" Bipra added to this, saying, ""While you can study from anywhere, online degrees also require a lot of self-discipline and time management since there are fewer face-to-face reminders or interactions with teachers."" Besides, when it comes to online degrees or education, concerns surrounding isolation and missing out on campus life are always there. ""At first, I did feel a sense of isolation, wondering if I was missing out on the traditional university experience,"" said Shristy. ""But over time, my priorities shifted. I needed to work, not just to be another graduate in Bangladesh, but to truly grow. I gained real-world experience, explored fellowship programmes, and also ran a business that funded my education. By my fourth year of studies, I had no regrets."" Bipra pointed out another drawback, ""What I hate is the complete lack of interaction with the institution offline. Students might feel a bit isolated because they do not meet classmates in person, and group activities or discussions can feel less engaging through a screen."" He added, ""In-person university offers a more traditional experience where students go to a campus, attend live lectures, and meet their classmates and teachers face-to-face. It is easier to make friends, ask questions immediately, and join clubs or events. The environment feels more social and active."" Despite the isolating academic experience, people pursuing such online programmes manage to find community in their own way, as was the case with Jany. ""Even though we do not have the traditional campus life, it never felt like anything was missing. We build connections virtually through peer discussions, private messages, and feedback on assignments."" The shift to online learning also transformed how they approach education. Shristy now follows a fixed routine, usually studying from Thursday night to Saturday night. Jany, on the other hand, believes that online learning made her more disciplined and helped improve her research and time management skills. Still, a major challenge remains, which is perception. ""Some people still think online degrees are not real or that you did not earn them properly,"" said Shristy. ""But I was lucky to work with people who understand how times are changing."" Shristy did face some pushback. ""I did have one tough experience, where an interview for a role questioned my online degree, and they seemed shocked by it."" Despite that, Shristy went on to do an internship at Chaldal and is now working there full-time as a product operations associate. Bipra too believes that online education has a strong future, but not without limits. Jany agrees with this, saying that attitudes need to change. According to her, many people still do not understand how structured or credible online education is. But once they learn more about it, their opinion usually changes.","Wed May 14, 2025 07:21 PM         Last update on: Wed May 14, 2025 07:26 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/are-late-night-study-sessions-effective-3894621","Are late night study sessions effective?","As the world drifts into slumber, the quiet symphony of flickering desk lamps and rustling pages accompanies the solitary student studying late into the night. The solitude of the silent hours sets the stage for nocturnal study sessions, where late-night reading and practice tests replace sleep. Students regularly pull all-nighters as a coping mechanism to deal with the horrors of academic pressure. Whether a dedicated night owl or a last-minute crammer, staying up late to study is a staple of the student experience for all. The appeal of night-time studying often stems from necessity rather than preference. Daytime usually pass in juggling class schedules and extra-curriculars, with most students finding it challenging to allocate sufficient time for self-evaluation. Thus, as burning the midnight oil to catch up on coursework starts looking like a fair exchange, sleep transforms into a luxury that feels almost unattainable. However, do late-night study sessions truly offer the environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation that individuals desire? For many, studying during the night is their only option. The importance of comfortable, personal study spaces is undeniable; however, many students don't have access to these spaces. For instance, growing up in overcrowded households usually means there is an absence of quiet corners so maintaining focus turns into a constant battle against distractions. For those living in bustling metropolitans, their ability to concentrate is compromised by incessant vehicular noises and chaotic clutter. As a response, many turn to late-night studying as a final resort. According to research conducted at the University of Notre Dame, people who stay up late perform better in terms of memory retention. This phenomenon is attributed to what experts call 'retroactive interference'. Studying during the daytime leads to interruptions and the continual influx of new information which increases the likelihood of forgetting previously learned material. The brain can understand information more efficiently before sleep, enhancing the ability to recall important details. Furthermore, people with short attention spans and those who depend on last-minute work for their exams sometimes find themselves performing better during the after-hours. The adrenaline rush of working against a deadline heightens motivation, turning procrastination into a driving force for productivity. When exam seasons loom, many students rely on cramming overnight to get by. However, studying during odd hours comes with significant health risks, primarily rooted in a lack of sleep disrupting a person's biological clock. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to long-term health problems. Research shows that consistently staying up late affects the body's circadian rhythms, which regulate sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and metabolism. Over time, this disruption can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and weakened immune function. Sleep deprivation also takes a toll on mental health. Missing out on sleep temporarily boosts dopamine levels, constructing a feeling of short-term euphoria. This short-lived high can impair decision-making and lead to impulsive behaviour. For students who constantly rely on studying during the night, these effects may accumulate and lead to a decrease in overall academic performance and well-being. Despite offering a short-term solution, studying past midnight often leads to diminished productivity throughout the following day. Lack of sleep makes it harder to build focus during classes, retain new information, or participate fully in academic discussions. As a result, students may find themselves trapped in a cycle of exhaustion, where they are constantly catching up but failing to get ahead. With the fleeting benefits of late-night studying weighed against its lasting toll, the question remains: is it a sustainable practice? The choice narrows down to whether the short bursts of focus at night are worth the long-term consequences. For those who feel trapped by the chaos of daytime, one approach could be shifting study hours to early mornings when thought processes sharpen and the surrounding environment is still calm. Studying in public spaces like libraries or reading cafes can also provide a focused atmosphere without the need to stay up late. Ultimately, the goal is to find a balance supporting both effective learning and overall well-being. References: 1. Notre Dame News (March 23, 2012).

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/the-lives-international-medical-students-bangladesh-3894586","The lives of international medical students in Bangladesh","Many of us have thought of pursuing a degree abroad. If we were to set aside the practical aspects of this process and instead shift our focus on to the emotional toll that it takes on a student, we would notice phases of excitement mixed with dashes of fear and anxiety. Excitement because the student would get to experience a whole new country – all on their own – possibly for the first time in their life. Fear precisely because they would be in a whole new country, all alone, thousands of miles away from their loved ones. It could be one of the most unique experiences in a student's life. Now imagine if the country the student is flying into was Bangladesh. Many of the universities in Bangladesh have foreign students studying a range of subjects. But by far, the degree most foreign students come to pursue is a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). Currently, 221 out of 5380 seats are reserved for foreign students in government colleges. In private colleges, a large fraction of the intake can be foreign students. Currently, there are over 10,000 medical students only from India. Students from Pakistan, Nepal, Jammu and Kashmir, and even Palestine come to study MBBS here. To get an overview of their experiences, Campus reached out to a few international students and had them discuss numerous aspects of their lives in Bangladesh. ""Everything about leaving your country and your comfort zone and moving to a different part of the world is challenging. A big challenge is adjusting to the environment and culture,"" said Isaaq N Namoura, A fifth-year student from Palestine studying at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College. ""There's a language barrier present here. When I started off, I didn't know that classes would be in Bangla. I didn't get to take a Bangla course when I first came over. English was challenging too as it isn't my first language, and neither is it for my teachers'. So, we struggled to communicate a lot in the beginning. Now that I've learned Bangla though, conversing has become much easier. However, the curriculum should definitely include an introductory course in Bangla,"" he added. Another student from Assam, Angela Shirin, studying at Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College said, ""MBBS is tough, and being away from home, especially when you see your mates going home every weekend, is super hard. For instance, if I get homesick right now, I need to cross an entire country to go home. And the hardest part is you never know if things at home are going to be the same as when you left. The constant fear and worry about my family take a toll on me. Among the challenges I've had to overcome and adapt to, the climate ranks number one. It's way too hot and humid out here. The language barrier had been a problem, but with time I got a handle on it. All you need to do is learn these words: mama, baam pashe, daan pashe, shomosshha nai."" When asked about her clinical experience and interacting with patients, she said, ""I remember a humorous interaction where I was asked to palpate the liver of a middle-aged man. I struggled to ask him to move his shirt aside. I blurted out something close in Bangla, but the patient didn't quite understand what I was trying to say. He proceeded to reply in a different dialect perhaps, but I couldn't grasp it. So, I acted out what I wanted him to do, which was when he finally understood."" ""I think the Bangla word for lung is very funny. I chuckle a bit every time I come across a patient with some lung pathology,"" she added. Having a social life, making friends, or finding job opportunities for some extra cash is made difficult not only by the language barrier but by the cultural barrier as well. Settling into hostel culture and interacting with locals poses its own set of challenges. Regarding this, Isaaq said, ""The whole new experience, the whole new set of regulations, culture, and people is exciting to me. The other thing I didn't even realise is I'd enjoy electricity and running water 24/7. This isn't a privilege we always have in Palestine. So, it really provides some much-needed perspective."" Naveed Shahrier, a final-year student from Kashmir said, ""Managing your social life is something that isn't addressed enough. It starts with your hostel roommates and batch mates. Often, what begins as congenial friendships grow colder over time. Most of the time, you feel a burden of loneliness. It's a situation that cannot be easily communicated to someone who hasn't experienced being in a foreign land."" He also spoke about the availability of job opportunities for foreign students, ""If you see a Kashmiri in the streets of Dhaka, he's either a shawl vendor selling our renowned shawls or a medical student studying in a private medical college. For pocket money, a few foreign students have found a niche as social media influencers. It's apparently a good source of income. One of my juniors, Abhishek Jajariya, a Rajasthani third-year student, has been doing inspirational work. He's cashing in six figures a month providing online tutoring to junior students and acting as a consultant. Besides this, many students vlog about their experience here and get endorsement deals. Many Kashmiris are also sought by modelling agencies to pose for local brands."" As for the quality of education and cooperation from faculty members, Angela remarked that faculty members from her college have been friendly and considerate. ""They always consider granting us additional leave, empathise with us, and also understand the difficulties of living so far from home for long stretches,"" she said. Looking back at the tumultuous times of the July uprising in 2024, she explained, ""I was really touched (by the faculty members' conduct) when chaos built up in Bangladesh last year. All colleges were shut down and we were stuck here. A few of the teachers were really concerned and made sure we got home safely. In addition, we addressed our concerns about not resuming classes right away."" ""Not only were they considerate enough to postpone the items (daily viva exams) till we arrived but also assured us that we could take the exams online or when we came back to Bangladesh, if we missed it. I have always openly shared my problems, be it personal or academic, with some of the teachers, and they have always been helpful,"" she said. Although Bangladesh welcomes a considerable number of medical students every year, there still remains a lot to account for if we truly want to be a hub for medical education. The Directorate General for Health Services (DGHS), for instance, could take steps to improve the experience of foreign students pursuing an MBBS degree in Bangladesh.  Munna Yadav, a student from Nepal at Dhaka Medical College said, ""Bangladesh is a prime destination for medical education, as there is good clinical exposure here with high patient flow. Yet some hurdles persist. Foreign students doing internships at government medical colleges do not receive any compensation. Some private colleges do pay, but there is a lack of uniformity there as well."" ""Besides, private medical colleges don't provide enough information about their institutions online or in circulars, which makes the process of direct admission tough. It also forces many to rely on consultancies. The country often goes through spells of political turmoil but there is no government body or special unit from the DGHS to counsel or reassure foreign students about their safety. These issues are holding this sector back and need to be addressed,"" he elaborated. Prof. Md Mustafizur Rahman, former Vice-Principal of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College, stated that Bangladesh is a hub for medical education in South Asia due to the quality of education being offered, exposure to a broad spectrum of clinical cases, and the low cost at which the education is being offered. However, there is still room for improvement.  ""Our faculty members are very conscious about the needs of international students, even more so than our domestic students sometimes because we acknowledge international students may have a hard time fitting in here and naturally may require closer attention and care. Yes, we have space for improvement when it comes to accommodation and one-stop services for these students. We hope by incorporating these facilities in the future, Bangladesh will secure its place as an ideal destination for medical education,"" he said. As things stand, we are offering quality medical education at a competitive price compared to the global market. However, a unified and transparent approach to the admission process for foreign nationals, which would be applicable to all medical colleges, is of utmost necessity. Special counsellors also have to be assigned by the DGHS for any emergency needs the students may have. And though the medium of education will remain in English, incorporating an introductory Bangla language course for foreign students will go a long way in helping them interact with patients better. The place where one completes their undergraduate becomes a second home of sorts. With that in mind, it should be our holistic goal to provide these individuals – who have left their homelands to study in our medical colleges – a standardised academic experience as well as an amiable social experience. It is our hope that if they return to their homelands, they will remember their alma mater with fondness and Bangladesh as a second home.

The new show had big shoes to fill, and for the most part, it succeeds in being a worthy continuation of the original show with a stellar storyline, well-developed characters and brutal action sequences. The story takes place several years after the ending of the original series. Matt Murdock, having abandoned his superhero identity, is compelled to return when Wilson Fisk (The Kingpin) becomes New York's mayor and begins a conspiracy to outlaw masked vigilantes while expanding his criminal empire. Before starting the critical analysis, it is important to note that halfway through production, the show went through a complete creative overhaul. Essentially, before the show had fewer connections both in terms of tone and storyline to the previous series. They included previously completed episodes but also added new content that connected it to the Netflix series. The show's resulting mixture of two different visions is apparent, with episodes clearly distinguishable as pre- and post-overhaul. The weakest parts of the show are the pre-overhaul episodes. While it starts off solid, the plot progresses very slowly, with Matt not suiting up as Daredevil for quite a long time. The newer supporting characters are not as nuanced or likeable as Foggy Nelson and Karen Page from the original series, and it is even more evident when those characters eventually show up here. They introduced a new villain named Muse, who began as an intriguing character, but unfortunately, his arc did not live up to its potential. However, other new characters like the superhero White Tiger and Daniel Blake, Fisk's protégé, were genuinely interesting and added depth to the narrative. That being said, the rest of the show proves why Charlie Cox's Daredevil remains arguably the best-written hero in the MCU. His rivalry and dynamic with Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin continues to be iconic, and the expert cinematography and visual storytelling of the scenes just add icing on the cake to their respective character arcs. Returning characters such as Benjamin Poindexter (Bullseye) and Frank Castle (The Punisher) have their own mini-arcs that further add tension and nuance to the story. Despite the slow build, the character development and overall narrative make the show amazing. The major problem with MCU heroes, such as the Avengers, is that they seldom deal with ""real"" problems that affect everyday people. They're always fighting aliens, monsters, or a threat to the planet or multiverse, and the movies focus heavily on massive CGI battles rather than showing the heroes actually ""save"" civilians. Daredevil actually deals with grounded issues, and this show in particular parallels real-world issues of corrupt people becoming politicians and exploiting average citizens. Besides the obvious parallel between Fisk's election and Trump's presidency, an interesting plot point is also featured where corrupt cops use the Punisher's logo to commit murders, reflecting the real-world misuse of the symbol by American police and far-right white supremacists. Despite a few weaknesses, like the pacing issues and inconsistent episode quality, Daredevil: Born Again is a fantastic show with compelling characters, a narrative that strays away from the standard superhero fare in favour of realistic world building. It is undoubtedly one of the best projects in the MCU in the past few years, and a worthy follow-up to the fan-favourite Netflix show.","Sat May 17, 2025 03:17 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 03:28 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/education/news/struggles-writing-research-paper-undergrad-3892156","Struggles of writing a research paper as an undergrad","Have you ever started a research paper with a head full of ideas only to hit a wall mid-way? This is a common experience for many undergrads writing their first research paper. What begins as an exciting dive into a topic can quickly devolve into a frustrating maze of tedious work. Even though the end result is rewarding, the process is filled with roadblocks that might feel insurmountable unless tackled with patience and tact. Struggling with team coordination One of the most challenging aspects of writing a research paper is finding the right team. Initially, teaming up may feel like a brilliant idea — tasks can be easily divided and deadlines seem within reach! But soon you realise it's not that simple. Clashing schedules, different work ethics, and last-minute panics quickly turn what was supposed to be a group effort into a source of stress. To avoid these pitfalls, set clear goals from the beginning, maintain a shared calendar to keep everyone on track, and arrange regular meetings to keep everyone accountable and organised. Difficulty in finding study participants Research relies on valid data, responses from survey findings, or interviews. While reaching out to people for these surveys and interviews, however, oftentimes emails sit unnoticed, messages get ignored, and forms remain incomplete. The clock keeps ticking but you keep not being able to find enough research participants to meet your data requirements. At some point, you start wondering; ""Will I have enough responses to complete this research on time?"" To increase participation and gather sufficient data, diversify your network and cast a wide net through social media, offer incentives to participants, and send follow-up reminders to ensure a timely submission of responses. Facing writer's block Your participants are ready, your research topic is on track, and the deadline is set. But then the dreaded writer's block creeps in. Ideas buzz in your mind, yet the words refuse to take shape and you end up staring at a blank page for hours on end. Every researcher knows this struggle — it's as if a battle is being waged in your mind between thoughts and words while time keeps slipping away. To get the words flowing, outline your thoughts in bullet points before expanding them into paragraphs. Discussing your ideas with a peer may also be the catalyst you need to spark creativity. The challenge of understanding unfamiliar topics Writing a paper becomes more challenging when tackling a topic you know little about. Starting a paper on an unfamiliar topic can be overwhelming in and of itself; limited online resources for primary research can further complicate this process. Although this obstacle is manageable over time and with effort, the initial lack of knowledge often feels like a significant hurdle, making it difficult to know where to begin. To understand your topic clearly, reach out to professors or experts and form study groups with classmates who have a stronger grasp of the topic and can share valuable insights and resources. Formatting and citation Citations are far more than a formality in academic writing. They are necessary for maintaining academic integrity and safeguarding against plagiarism. The problem with this final part of the paper begins with understanding the different styles of citation — APA, MLA, Chicago, and more. From punctuation placement to italicisation, the slightest mistake can undermine the credibility of an otherwise well-organised paper. Moreover, the fear of plagiarism looms large — forgetting to cite a source can have serious academic consequences. To keep track of your sources and ensure correct formatting, use citation management tools online or consult with a librarian to ensure accuracy. The pressure of balancing research with coursework A good paper needs constant effort to make progress. However, just when you think you are making progress, a string of assignments, project work, and quizzes pile up at your university. The constant switch between tasks makes it difficult to focus and research often gets sidelined. Finding a balanced routine to prioritise academics without neglecting your research becomes hard. To reduce the pressure, employ time management techniques like the Pomodoro method, which breaks work down into 25-minute intervals with short breaks, to enhance focus. If needed, discuss workload management with academic advisors to find a balanced approach. The entire research process can lead to burnout with you constantly doubting your every effort. However, it is important to see these obstacles as part of the learning process. Each struggle is a chance to build critical thinking abilities and time management skills. And, in the end, it all feels worthwhile when you finally see your work getting published and gaining recognition from your peers.  Nusrat Meherin Faiza is a writer, tutor, and chronic overthinker.

Late nights? Banned. Junk food? Dream on. Spontaneous outings? Only if they involved groceries. Screen time? Monitored like a national security threat. But somehow, the older I got, the more I realised those no's weren't roadblocks; they were safety nets. Back then, it felt unfair. While my friends lived the best life—junk food, sleepovers, Netflix marathons—I was indoors doing homework under the watchful eyes of General Mom. I called it ""house arrest"". She called it ""parenting"". But here's the thing I didn't realise until much later: she wasn't trying to ruin my life; she was trying to shape it. While I saw restrictions, she saw protection. While I sulked about rules, she was silently building me a future where I'd thank her for every ""no"" she ever said. But with time, things changed. One day, curious about her sudden chill mode, I asked why she wasn't as strict anymore. She looked at me with that knowing smile and said, ""There's a time for everything."" No long explanation; just one of those quiet truths she always seems to carry in her back pocket. We expect mothers to be superhuman. Warmth on demand, food on the table, patience always stocked, and a smile through every chaos. But we forget – this is her first time too. She is figuring things out as she goes, making mistakes, getting back up, and doing it all over again. Coming to working moms? Absolute legends. They clock out of the office and clock into their second job without flinching. Stay-at-home moms? Equally heroic, running homes like CEOs, minus the bonuses and coffee breaks. Society often praises what it can see – promotions, paychecks, performance reviews. But motherhood is measured in lullabies sung through exhaustion, meals cooked without complaint, lessons taught through patience, and love given endlessly, even when none is returned. To every mother – whether you're balancing board meetings and baby bottles, or spending your days running a home that never pauses – you are more than enough. And my mom? She juggled both roles. She worked a full-time job and still made time for spelling tests, fever checks, surprise Tupperware hunts, and emotional therapy sessions disguised as dinner chats. I, of course, still found reasons to complain – cold food, a house not organised, and clothes not ironed (my own fault, but still). So if you ever wonder what a superhero looks like—don't look up. Look home. She's probably in the kitchen reheating your food... again. So, here's to the unsung hero in every home. To every mother – who makes love look easy, patience look endless, and multitasking look magical. Because let's face it—if motherhood were a paid job, no company could afford the salary.","Sun May 11, 2025 07:37 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 07:47 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/how-the-us-funding-cuts-are-affecting-international-graduate-students-3889106","How the US funding cuts are affecting international graduate students","Academia in the US has been severely shaken after the second term of the Trump administration began in January. From federal funding cuts to demands for policy changes, many universities have been hit hard, with international students feeling the brunt of the effects. Many US federal agencies have had their funds slashed or have been ordered to be slashed or frozen, including the National Institute of Health (NIH) which funds portions of medical research in many research institutions nationwide. This has, in turn, led to research grants being cut or threatened to be cut for many universities in the US, causing major layoffs and jeopardising research in the medical field, climate sciences, and social sciences. The Trump administration has been actively leveraging the NIH funding to force US universities to change their policies regarding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and pro-Palestine sentiments on campus. As a result, universities are having to shrink department sizes, reduce student intake, slash funding for students, and even rescind offer letters. This has created immense uncertainty for current and prospective international students, who already face more barriers than domestic students, and may have far-reaching consequences for the future of academia. ""Despite their prestige, US schools feel increasingly inaccessible. It's hard to commit to a programme when financial uncertainty constantly looms over the experience,"" says Anika Tabassum Amreen, a US graduate school applicant. Higher education in the US is notorious for being incredibly expensive, more so for international students, but this was alleviated by the generous scholarships given by US schools. However, now that those scholarships are far fewer in number due to funding cuts, they have become much less reliable. Students who had hoped for these scholarships to fund their higher education now face the unprecedented challenge of navigating other ways of securing funding. While domestic students can still work and pay for their tuition, international students don't enjoy the same freedom. ""As an international student, employment is restricted to on-campus jobs, making the search even more challenging,"" says Amreen. Furthermore, graduate assistantships and other on-campus opportunities can be highly competitive, making them inaccessible to most students.  So what other choice are international students left with? Not much. Financial burdens and visa uncertainties are leading many to reconsider the US as their study destination. ""I am not going to be prioritising US programmes for the time being until there is more clarity regarding the situation surrounding higher education there,"" says Hamza Mohammed, a prospective PhD student, who had initially intended to study in the US but is now considering other regions as well, such as Europe. Many students applying to US schools have also reported that their admissions or scholarships were rescinded. ""Cornell is trying to make sure the current students have secured funding before taking in new students,"" says Nabila Nawar Binti, a graduate research assistant at Cornell University. More than one billion USD in funding for Cornell was frozen according to the White House. While it is only right that universities prioritise supporting their already existing students before they can fund incoming ones, this puts prospective students at a disadvantage as it makes admission and securing scholarships that much more difficult. ""Two of the universities where I had obtained funding informed me that they will no longer be able to provide the promised funding due to cuts to their research budgets,"" says Hamza. As the US is the premier study destination for students around the world, this will certainly put the academic aspirations of many international students in jeopardy. The funding cuts are not only affecting prospective students in the US but also current ones. ""A lot of the students who expected funding were still doing rotations when they found out about the cuts, so they had to find additional rotations while their funding was frozen,"" says Nabila. Rotations are short research experiences, usually spanning a few weeks, that graduate students cycle through in order to gain experience and find which research areas are best suited for them. Having to do more lab rotations, because the funding for their own research got frozen, spells delays for these students' own research work, which is a significant hurdle for students who want to complete their degrees in a timely manner. Universities themselves have also been struggling to manage, with massive damage being done to research efforts. Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, told The Guardian, ""Members of mine are having to lay people off and having to close their labs. It's been a complete, utter, destruction of the United States research infrastructure."" This not only affects students' education but also on-campus employment opportunities for current students, as many international students rely on research assistant and teaching assistant positions to pay for their tuition. If laid off, they will be left without this support, and the financial burden may become unbearable. The Trump administration's demand for scrapping DEI programmes that supported underrepresented and underprivileged groups can also have a significant impact on international students. An example of DEI programmes that support international students is the International Mentoring Program at Brown University which pairs incoming international students with mentors from within the student body to guide them in academic and social matters. Another example is the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW), a student association at the University of Washington which provides students identity-based support, access to legislative advocacy, and inclusive programming. If the DEI scrapping measures target programmes and organisations such as this, international students will be left at a disadvantage. The administration also demanded that institutions change their admission processes ""to prevent admitting international students hostile to the American values"", without clearly specifying what is exactly meant by ""American values"". This is certain to harm many international students from around the world, whose academic careers could be harmed by such arbitrary notions. Additionally, the government's demands that universities must report students engaged in political protests and overhaul their campus protest policies in order to address ""anti-semitism"" will not only negatively impact many current students but also deter many international students from applying to American universities in the near future.  Columbia University has yielded to many of the administration's demands, in hopes of restoring funding worth USD 400 million. On the other hand, Harvard University has refused to budge despite threats of massive funding cuts, with its president Alan Garber asserting Harvard's commitment to autonomy as a private institution. Following Harvard's lead, a collective of other elite schools have joined forces to combat the demands made by the Trump administration, with their leaders reportedly having discussions on how to effectively resist said demands. Other prominent universities, such as Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Michigan, have also been targeted by the administration. At this point, it is a lose-lose situation for international students, because if the universities yield to the demands, it will make higher education a lot more tumultuous for them as the DEI measures will have to be scrapped, they will be scrutinised more heavily during the admission process, and there will be a looming threat of losing funding should the universities accept more of the Trump administration's whims in the future. However, if the universities decide to resist instead, they will probably have much less money at their disposal, thus many international students will be left without funding or even admission offers. International students make invaluable contributions towards research in the US. Thus, considering the difficulties they face now and are likely to continue facing under the current administration, the future of American graduate education looks grim. With a smaller pool of researchers, a shrunken budget, and the general volatility of the political climate, a perfect storm beckons over the horizon. ""Not only budget cuts, but visa revocation of many international students in recent times, along with some other probable policy changes will grossly impact the future of graduate education,"" says Dr Tanvir R Faisal, an assistant professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. On top of all this chaos, the visa application process is already mired with a great deal of uncertainty. Even if you get offered admission and somehow manage to secure sufficient funding, there is always the possibility that your visa will be rejected and your dreams of attending graduate school in the US will be shattered. This is nothing new, but it piles up with all the other obstacles that prospective international students are facing. It is still difficult to tell exactly how detrimental the Trump administration's actions will be to academia, but there is no doubt that they will be severe. And yet, hope cannot be lost, and there are practical measures that can be taken to mitigate the onslaught of funding cuts. According to Dr Faisal, ""One possible option is (for universities) to negotiate with state legislators to increase state-level funding, increase industrial ties for funding, and discuss/raise the issues with congressmen/~women and senators of respective states/congressional districts to reinstate or increase the federal budget for higher education."" Needless to say, the recent measures taken by US President Trump have caught the world of academia off guard, especially international students. Arguably, they are feeling the worst of the effects, from slashed funding to fewer opportunities to even being targeted by authorities. Only time will tell how much longer these conditions will persist, and much will depend on how university authorities decide to tackle the administration's demands and what they do to counteract them.

Although the schedule was published on time, the election date has now been deferred. It is worth mentioning that on April 29, the university administration held an 11-hour meeting with the Environment Council -- formed to oversee the electoral climate -- and student representatives, followed by an administrative meeting from 5:00pm to 11:30pm on April 30. The election schedule was announced after these meetings. The university authorities have also published a revised charter for Jucsu and the hall unions. According to the new charter, the union will consist of 27 posts, of which 25 will be elected. The posts of president and treasurer will remain unelected, reserved for the vice-chancellor and treasurer of the university, respectively. Despite demands from most student bodies, the revised charter keeps the president's post as an ex-officio role for the vice-chancellor.

The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the university's syndicate held last night. Kuet's Public Relations Officer Shaheduzzaman Sheikh said the report, which was submitted by the investigation committee formed in February, was presented during the meeting. Based on the findings, the syndicate decided to suspend the 37 students and instructed that the matter be referred to the university's Student Disciplinary Committee for further action. The syndicate also decided to reopen all residential halls for students on May 2 and resume academic activities from May 4. However, the protesting students expressed dissatisfaction with the decisions. They announced that they would continue their sit-in demonstration in front of the administrative building until the halls are reopened. The students have been demonstrating since 3:00pm on Sunday and continued their protest for the second consecutive day on Monday. The agitating students said their demand was to reopen the halls from last night. They also complained that they were waiting for the authorities to formally inform them of the syndicate's decisions, but no official announcement was made. Instead, the university officials left the premises through a back gate after the meeting, avoiding the waiting students at the main gate, the protesters alleged. Students also said the prolonged closure of academic activities is hampering their studies. Many of them have lost tuition opportunities as they cannot stay in the halls. On February 18, a clash broke out between two student groups on the Kuet campus. One side, under the banner of general students, accused Chhatra Dal of attacking their anti-student-politics protest using outsiders. On the other hand, Chhatra Dal claimed that activists of the anti-discrimination student movement, under the guise of general students, along with Shibir members, attacked them. Following the incident, students began boycotting classes and launched a movement with six demands, including the resignation of the vice-chancellor, pro-vice-chancellor, and the director of student welfare, and a complete ban on student politics on campus. On February 23, a group of students submitted their six-point demand in writing to Kuet's chief adviser in Dhaka. Later, on February 25, the university syndicate decided to shut down all academic and administrative activities indefinitely and ordered all students to vacate the halls. At the same time, a three-member probe committee was formed to investigate the incident.","Tue Apr 15, 2025 09:04 AM         Last update on: Tue Apr 15, 2025 10:21 AM"

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/education/news/predatory-publications-what-are-they-and-why-they-pose-threat-academia-3828986","Predatory publications: What are they and why they pose a threat to academia","Imagine yourself in the position of a prospective academic, conducting research in your field of interest. The best – in fact, the only – way to grow in the world of academia is through having your work published. However, researchers often have to deal with the crushing anxiety that arises over not publishing as frequently, facing rejections, and looking out for conferences and journals to submit their work. All of this is most certainly not easy work. Moreover, it's very easy for young researchers to be completely overwhelmed by the sheer amount of patience and sustained effort it can take to have their names published even once. This is where the pitfall of predatory publishing comes in – a devastating scam that many junior researchers have fallen for. What is a predatory publication or journal? To understand how exactly a predatory journal functions, let's try to understand how academic publishing works in the first place. ""Peer-reviewed"" is a term that many may be familiar with – in academia, this serves as the bread and butter for all things that deal with research. According to Dr Md Kabir Uddin, an assistant professor at North South University's Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, ""For our research work to hold any merit, it must undergo a thorough review process before it is considered for publication. Predatory journals are dangerous because they are not reputed or considered by any scientist to hold any value. The biggest reason behind this is that these journals will provide no peer-review on your work, and sometimes they go as far as to publish falsified or doctored data under the guise of having done some 'research' work.""  The quality of the journal matters to academic institutions. The same applies to questionable conferences. It is much better for students to take the time to have their work featured in more respected and legitimate scholarly venues. This is a case where less is more. It is better to have less work published or featured in more notable outlets than it is to have a great deal of work published or featured in questionable outlets. Mahir Amer, a master's student in Biological Sciences at the University of Edinburg, further elaborates, ""A lot of faculties or researchers receive unsolicited emails asking them if they'd like to submit papers. These journals often have some major red flags that are pretty easily distinguishable if you spend some time in academia. Journals that publish on topics that have nothing to do with each other, exorbitant processing charges, and misleading claims about legitimacy are all indicators."" Similar sentiments are echoed by Dr Mahbubul H Siddiqee, an associate professor of Microbiology at BRAC University, who goes on to paint an image of how predatory journals plague researchers, specifically in Bangladesh. ""A big portion of mainly young researchers in our country have had some dealings with predatory journals. A whole lot of these cases do not occur by accident, as many researchers are driven by this 'publish-or-perish' culture that permeates academia today,"" he lamented, highlighting a core issue of how research is perceived in the country. Why do students and researchers submit their work to predatory publications?
 According to a study by Umme Habiba and SM Zabed Ahmed, over 79 percent of participants admitted that the rapid acceptance and publication time provided by predatory journals might be a motivating factor for researchers to submit their work in these spaces. But why would any researcher care for that? The answer comes from Dr Mahbubul who says, ""Young faculty members looking to make their CVs heavy will definitely make use of this – especially because many universities in Bangladesh don't have strict restrictions against hiring researchers who have published their work in these predatory journals. Many lecturers and assistant professors also use these to increase their publication rate as a means of obtaining promotions as universities in our country have particular criteria that are concerned about the number of publications one makes over the quality of their publication.""  I see no issue with students getting published in such publications, at least during their undergraduate studies. In most cases, students aren't aware of or don't have much knowledge of the journal communities or industry. During their postgraduate or doctoral education, this is viewed differently. During these times, the publication and reputation of the journal are reviewed better. The impact of getting published in a predatory journal
 It is evident, thus, that a lack of awareness and general apathy regarding research work has led to this practice being far more commonplace than it has any right to be. It is true that no matter your field, conducting research in a resource-strained country like Bangladesh can disillusion even the brightest minds. The appeal of these predatory journals begins here. Complete with deceitful indexing information and false claims to scope, these journals are often sought out by researchers for the sake of boosting their own reputation in the eyes of others – not realising the damage it causes to their name as a researcher on an international stage. Published research, after all, is scrutinised thoroughly by academics across the world. Dr Nneka Logan, an associate professor at the School of Communication at Virginia Tech University, reflects on this, ""The quality of the journal matters to academic institutions. The same applies to questionable conferences. It is much better for students to take the time to have their work featured in more respected and legitimate scholarly venues. This is a case where less is more. It is better to have less work published or featured in more notable outlets than it is to have a great deal of work published or featured in questionable outlets."" Undergraduate students looking to enter academia, be it in the sciences or humanities, certainly have their work cut out for them. When playing on an international stage, as researchers so often do, it is important to rigorously understand how academic publications work. And while there is a definite group of people who are apathetic towards publishing in high-impact journals, one thing that also requires discussion here is the lack of knowledge that plagues researchers in Bangladesh regarding predatory journals. In the study by Habiba and Ahmed, it was suggested that many of the participants were simply confused by the terminology of ""predatory publication"". Nearly half of these participants, the majority of whom were assistant professors, did not feel confident enough to assess a journal's quality all by themselves. This poses an issue that is institutional in nature, and as such has to be dismantled from the ground up. University students, despite not necessarily being in charge of what research is being carried out, have a massive role to play here. After all, these are the same people who will eventually take on the roles of professors and researchers. If – through cultural diffusion – their perception of research is altered to favour predatory publishing, then where does that put us? And if these students are accidental victims of having their work printed in a predatory journal, then what implications does that have for their future? To this end, Dr -Ing Ulrich Vogt, Head of the Department of Flue Gas Cleaning and Air Quality Control at the University of Stuttgart, offers a sliver of hope. ""I see no issue with students getting published in such publications, at least during their undergraduate studies. In most cases, students aren't aware of or don't have much knowledge of the journal communities or industry,"" he claimed. ""During their postgraduate or doctoral education, this is viewed differently. During these times, the publication and reputation of the journal are reviewed better,"" he added. While undergraduate students may have some leeway in this case, it is clear that beyond this boundary, publication in a predatory journal can come with serious repercussions. The lack of awareness, which seems to be a pervading issue, has to be addressed within every respective university. Additionally, there is also a subculture that thrives on 'quick and dirty' work as future repercussions aren't considered. It is imperative for university students and young academics to be keenly aware of both sides of the problem, and to establish programmes that allow these problems to come to light.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/education/news/guide-the-chevening-scholarship-law-students-3817736","A guide to the Chevening Scholarship for Law students","The Chevening Scholarship is one of the most prestigious scholarships funded by the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) with an acceptance rate of less than 3 percent. For 41 years now, Chevening has been supporting international students from Commonwealth countries who wish to study in the UK. In 2024, Chevening received over 60,000 applicants from all over the world and from Bangladesh, 27 applicants were accepted to pursue their postgraduate studies in the UK with a scholarship. The Chevening Scholarship covers everything from tuition fees to living expenses. Being an incredibly competitive scholarship, it has a unique eligibility criterion. An aspiring applicant will need to have an undergraduate degree that qualifies them to pursue a postgraduate degree at a UK university, two years of work experience, and be a citizen of a Commonwealth country. A successful applicant will also need to possess and show the following excellent leadership capabilities, great networking skills, a clear career plan, and two references attesting to their potential to complete a challenging degree in the UK. Start early and strategically
 When I look back on my journey from an aspiring applicant to a current Chevening scholar, the first thing I go back to is how early I had started my preparations. Chevening applications normally open in August and close in November. I started working on my essays and getting in touch with my referees in June 2023. Prior to that, for a year, I focused on enhancing my resume to ensure that my professional and academic experiences aligned with Chevening's core values of leadership, networking, and career development. I began taking up more voluntary leadership roles within my university as an MUN mentor, a mooting coach, and a member of the self-assessment committee for curriculum development. I made sure that I had a clear career plan to work with when applying because that is one of the most important things to know as an aspiring Chevening scholar. Crafting a strong professional profile Chevening places a strong emphasis on professional achievements and leadership potential. As a Law student, I had the advantage of doing internships at both local law firms and legal aid organisations. However, what stood out in my application was my teaching experience and my commitment to legal education reform and innovative teaching strategies as an intersectional educator. This experience demonstrated my ability to inspire and mentor others, a trait Chevening highly values. Articulating your vision Your career-plan essay is the heart of your application. For Law students, it's essential to demonstrate how your expertise can address pressing legal issues or contribute to policy reforms in your home country. In my case, I focused on my passion for human rights law. I highlighted my work with a non-governmental organisation that provided legal aid to marginalised communities, explaining how this experience shaped my commitment to social justice. I also outlined my aspiration to influence legal education in Bangladesh by introducing more practical and interdisciplinary approaches. Remember, specificity is key; avoid vague statements and back your claims with concrete examples. The value of academic and extracurricular achievements While professional experience is crucial, academic excellence is equally important for aspiring Chevening scholars. If you have achievements like having academic publications, research and teaching experience, and experience with moot court competitions, make sure to highlight them. Extracurricular activities, such as volunteering or participating in pro bono initiatives, can also set you apart. Work experience does not mean full-time work; it can be voluntary, part-time, or even internship experience. Preparing for the interview The Chevening interview is your chance to bring your application to life. I approached it as a conversation – essentially a dialogue between intellectuals as opposed to an interview where I am getting grilled. To prepare, I reviewed my essays thoroughly and practised articulating my responses to common questions about leadership, networking, and career goals. I also prepared specific anecdotes to illustrate my points, ensuring they were concise yet impactful. Key tip: be authentic. Chevening is looking for individuals who are not only accomplished but also deeply motivated to create meaningful change, so let your passion shine through. Final thoughts The Chevening Scholarship is more than just funding; it's an opportunity to join a global network of change-makers. As a Law student, your unique perspective on justice and governance can make a significant impact. Start early, stay focused, and believe in the value of your journey. One really important thing that helped me was knowing exactly which field I would be contributing to in my home country after completing my studies in the UK. Also, most applicants make the mistake of making their essays too personal and don't paint a picture with examples and anecdotes of professional leadership and networking narratives. It is imperative to have a coherent link throughout all four of your essays. You need to ensure that your essays tell the story of who you are, what your aspirations are, how you plan to give back to your country and community, and why you would be an asset to the Chevening community. The more confident you are in yourself, your dreams, and your career trajectory, the better the chances of you going from an applicant to a Chevening scholar. With careful planning and a genuine commitment to your goals, you can make your Chevening dream a reality. Good luck! Mahapara Sanjana is a Chevening scholar and human rights defender with a passion for social justice and legal education reform. She is currently pursuing an MA in Social Justice and Education at the University of York in the UK with a Chevening Scholarship. Mahapara completed her Bachelor of Laws from BRAC University. Soon after graduating, she joined the legal aid and policy sector and worked in legal aid and development for a couple of years. She then proceeded to do her first masters in the UK and after coming back, she started teaching Law at Southeast University. She is currently on study leave from Southeast University pursuing her second masters in the UK as a Chevening scholar. With experience in legal research, teaching, and advocacy, Mahapara aims to empower marginalised communities and influence educational policy change in her home country. When she is not immersed in research and drowning in schoolwork, she can be found mentoring aspiring Law students and exploring intersectional and interdisciplinary approaches to legal challenges.

According to the pre-announced roadmap, the university administration was supposed to declare the election schedule yesterday, but this was not done, citing recommendations from the environment council formed to oversee the electoral processes of the upcoming JUCSU election. Several student organisations, including Chhatra Dal, leftist student groups, and nine organisations under the Sanskritik Jote (Cultural Alliance), are demanding necessary reforms to the JUCSU constitution before the election is held. To press this demand, over 100 hundred Chhatra Dal leaders and activists staged a sit-in protest in front of the university's new administrative building from 3:30pm to 6:00pm yesterday. The organisations have boycotted two discussion meetings called by the university administration regarding JUCSU, citing the administration's invitation to Islami Chhatra Shibir in the meetings and the presence of ""fascist"" pro-Awami League teachers in key administrative positions. On January 26, multiple leftist student organisations -- including Bangladesh Chhatra Union, Bangladesh Samajtantrik Chhatra Front, and Biplobi Chhatra Maitri -- issued a joint press release under the banner of Gonotantrik Chhatra Jote, advocating for reforms before the election. On the same day, nine organisations under the Sanskritik Jote also released a statement echoing the same demand. In response, several organisations -- including Students Against Discrimination, Chhatra Shibir, two organisations under the Sanskritik Jote, Gono Obbhunthan Rokkhya Andolon, Jahangirnagar Sanskar Andolon, and the July Gonohotta Bichar Nishchit Parishad -- staged a counter-protest around 6:30pm yesterday. More than a hundred leaders and activists from these groups demanded the immediate announcement of the election schedule. They also warned that if the schedule was not declared soon, they would obstruct the upcoming JU admission tests. Touhid Mohammad Siam, member secretary of the Students Against Discrimination JU unit, accused that outsiders are participating in Chhatra Dal's protest to pressure the administration into delaying the election schedule. ""If the election schedule is not announced before the upcoming admission test, we will not allow the test to take place,"" he said. On the other hand, JU Chhatra Dal Member Secretary Wasim Ahmed Onik emphasised the need for constitutional reforms before the election.

Addressing the media at the PSC office in Agargaon at 4:00pm, he announced a series of major reforms to the Bangladesh Civil Service examination process. ""Candidates have long requested the option to choose their preferred cadres before the viva. We have accepted that and decided to implement this from the 47th BCS onward,"" he said. The preliminary exam of the 47th BCS will be held from 10:00am to 12:00pm on June 27 in Dhaka, Rajshahi, Chattogram, Khulna, Barishal, Sylhet, Rangpur, and Mymensingh centres. The chairman also said that the viva voce score has been reduced from 200 to 100 marks starting from the 47th BCS to ensure a more balanced evaluation process. He said they want to complete the entire process — from prelims to recruitment — in 12 months. Addressing concerns of harassment during police verification of candidates before recruitment, Mobassher said to prevent any unnecessary harassment in the name of verification, the PSC will carry out basic background check of candidates themselves. ""Later, if required, other agencies may conduct additional background checks. But candidates will not face undue trouble."" He also announced changes to the current system of two examiners evaluating written scripts one after another. ""We are modifying that method and introducing a new system to speed up processing results."" The PSC is also working to revise the 2023 recruitment policy, which will enable the commission to recommend more candidates for non-cadre posts, he added. ""To streamline all commission activities within a set timeframe, we've developed a 'master calendar'. This will help eliminate delays in the BCS [recruitment] process,"" he said, adding, ""We are also working to make the process more transparent and efficient.""

The oral interviews of these candidates were conducted up until July 18 after a total of 11,732 examinees passed the 44th BCS written tests.   However, the oral exams were suspended on August 25, and the then-commission resigned on October 8. The newly formed commission decided to cancel the previously conducted interviews and restart oral examinations for all candidates who passed the written tests in order to ""maintain uniformity"", the PSC said in a press release yesterday.  The new dates for the oral examinations will be announced shortly, the press release added. In its first meeting, the newly appointed chairman and eight members of the PSC also made significant decisions on the 45th and 46th BCS tests, as well as various non-cadre exams. To ""ensure transparency and fairness"", the new commission also decided to send all answer scripts from the written tests of the 45th BCS to a third examiner for additional evaluation. The evaluation of the written answer scripts for the 45th BCS is ongoing, and the work of the second examiner is nearly complete, the press release noted. The BPSC is also reviewing and assessing the written exam for the post of sub-assistant engineer in Bangladesh Railway, with a decision on this examination expected soon.

When contacted for comments on why the results of 99 candidates were withheld, no officials from the ministry were willing to talk. However, a top official, wishing anonymity, told The Daily Star that some candidates recommended by the PSC did not attend the mandatory health check-up, and some others had ""incomplete information"". As a result, the results of about a hundred candidates remain on hold, he said. It should be noted that on December 26, 2023, the PSC had published the final results of the 43rd BCS, recommending the recruitment of 2,805 cadre and non cadre candidates. However, after the government fell on August 5, the interim administration began re-evaluating the background of 255 candidates recommended at the time.

They announced the withdrawal to journalists around 9:00pm after speaking to ICT Adviser Nahid Islam and Sports Adviser Asif Mahmud. Speaking to reporters, Rasel Al-Mahmud, one of the coordinators of 35 Prottashi Somonnoy Parishad, said, ""We'll attend tomorrow's [today's] meeting with the committee to reiterate our demand. The committee is to submit a report, based on our discussion, within seven days."" The administration yesterday formed a two-member committee to review the possibility of extending the age limit for applying for government jobs, following the protests by hundreds of job seekers in front of the chief adviser's residence in the capital. The public administration ministry issued a notification in this regard and asked the committee to submit its report within seven days. The committee is chaired by former caretaker government adviser Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury, with Mokhlesur Rahman, senior secretary of the public administration ministry, as the member-secretary. Around 11:00am, several hundred job seekers had gathered at Shahbagh to press for the age-limit extension. They then marched towards the chief adviser's residence, where police had set up barricades to bar them from moving forward. The protesters, however, broke through the barricades and continued chanting slogans. Around 1:15pm, a scuffle broke out between the demonstrators and law enforcers, after which police fired tear gas shells and stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Speaking to journalists, Ruman Kabir, one of the coordinators of 35 Prottashi Somonnoy Parishad, said, ""We condemn the police attack and question why tear gas was fired on a peaceful protest. We have no other option now but to seek a meeting with the chief adviser to present our demands."" Muzammel Miazee, another protester, explained the demand for extension. ""Currently, the age limit for applying for civil service jobs is 30. We're demanding it be increased to 35. We've been asking for this for 14 years but there has been no response from the government."" Another protester said, ""If the chief adviser can serve the state at the age of 70 [his actual age is 84] , why can't we access government jobs after the age of 30?"" Tahsin Mahmud, a student of Chittagong University, said, ""Our demand is logical, and the government should address it immediately. We're suffering from unemployment."" The age limit is 32 for only the children and grandchildren of freedom fighters. Protesters had blocked the Shahbagh intersection a few days ago with the same demand. Additionally, Bangladesh Administrative Service Association, an organisation of administration cadre officials, also demanded that the maximum age limit be raised to 35 and the retirement age to 65. It is to be noted that the Dhaka Metropolitan Police on August 25 issued a notice banning any rallies, meetings or demonstration in front of the Secretariat and government residence of the chief adviser until further notice.","Tue Oct 1, 2024 12:00 AM         Last update on: Tue Oct 1, 2024 03:30 AM"

Akib is affiliated with MIT's renowned Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and is working as a part of the Algorithmic Design Group led by Professor Mina Konaković Luković. Akib's academic journey began at Jessore Institute Government Primary School, Jashore, followed by Daud Public School and College, Jashore, and then Jhenaidah Cadet College, where he passed his SSC and HSC exams. He then joined the Bangladesh Army, later graduating from The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, England where he was awarded with the ""Best Overseas Student"" award. Later, Akib transitioned into academia where his current research interest lies in the intersection of robotics and computational geometry, specifically optimising the design of reconfigurable robots – an area full of exciting, futuristic possibilities. Campus sat down for a virtual interview with Akib where he shared more about his experiences, research, and insights. Campus (C): Could you tell us a bit about your current research? Akib (A): Initially, my research focused on the intersection of robotics and geometry processing, but now, I am specifically working on developing algorithms to optimise the design and control of shape-shifting robots. To put it simply, imagine the robots from the movie Transformers – machines that can change configurations. These Transformers have two configurations: a car mode for driving tasks, and a humanoid mode for combat tasks. But what if we could build robots with even more configurations? This initiative involves challenges like identifying the optimal design from a large search space and developing a central intelligence system to control the transformations. I am working on solving these problems, which require a deep understanding of geometry processing. I am also interested in extending this work using phase-changing materials, which could enable liquid shape-shifting robots, like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Imagine a soft robot capable of splitting its body to navigate through narrow arteries and locate cholesterol blockages. This technology has vast potential in robotics, especially for exploring unknown environments such as space, the deep ocean, and the human body. C: What were some of the most notable projects from your undergraduate years that align with your current research interests in robotics? A: During my first two years, I focused on strengthening my understanding of core Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) subjects like SPL, OOP, DSA, etc., without any involvement in robotics. My capstone project during my third year, ""Intelli-Helmet"", was a stress monitoring system for soldiers and it used EEG and heart rate data to identify post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This project was inspired by a scene from the TV series Band of Brothers, and it was published as my first research paper. Later, I worked on developing ""UVC-Purge"", a semi-autonomous robot designed to disinfect spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic using controlled ultraviolet-C (UVC) radiation. Our team won the championship in the ""Application Category"" at the Medical Robotics Challenge for Contagious Disease 2020, hosted by the UK Robotics & Autonomous Systems (UK-RAS) Network. This recognition, along with a GBP 5,000 grant, inspired me to further explore the field of robotics. C: What relevant initiatives did you take during your time at MIST? A: After winning the grant in the early part of my fourth year, my group and I had a dream of participating in the University Rover Challenge (URC), one of the most prestigious rover competitions in the world, organised by NASA's Mars Society. We presented our success with UVC Purge as proof of concept to MIST's higher authorities, and we were granted funding to pursue our vision. With an incredible team of around 50 members, we built the Mars rover from scratch, re-forming the Mongol Barota - MIST Mars Rover Society. In that year's virtual finals, we became the top-scoring team globally and produced another publication based on the novelty of our rover. C: We also understand that you have taught at United International University (UIU). How was your teaching experience there? A: After graduating in 2021, I joined UIU as a lecturer in its CSE department and had an exceptional work experience. During my tenure, I developed the UIU Mars Rover Team from scratch in September 2021, which earned international recognition under my direction as team mentor. We ranked the highest among Asian teams at the URC in 2022 and 2023, placing 13th and 9th globally, respectively. At the Anatolian Rover Challenge (ARC), we were the second runners-up worldwide. Continuing my initiatives from MIST, I always dreamt of establishing a world-class research laboratory under my supervision after completing my PhD, so I pioneered a miniature version of it at the heart of Dhaka by becoming one of the founders of the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at UIU. CAIR promotes ground, aerial, and underwater robotics research. Over two years, UIU invested more than BDT 2 crores into flourishing the robotics sector for which I am extremely grateful to the affiliated authority. I am proud to have contributed to laying the foundation for a lasting impact on future generations of robotics students and researchers. C: Could you please tell us how you approached the MIT application process? How did you connect with professors or research groups at MIT during that time? A: I didn't apply right after graduating in 2021 because I felt my profile wasn't strong enough to get into a top-tier university where I could pursue advanced research. So, I decided to take a year or two to strengthen my research experience. During that time, I worked with a professor at Rutgers University, USA, working on a deep learning framework for developing a sleep stage classification framework, and co-authored two research papers. I also collaborated with my thesis supervisor and colleagues at UIU on several research projects, which helped solidify my research portfolio. Around September 2022, I began compiling a list of professors whose research interests aligned with mine and whose labs I felt would be a good fit. I started networking with them, finding common ground before eventually reaching out to them via email. My target universities included Imperial College London and several top and mid-tier US universities based on the QS World University Rankings. In the end, I received acceptance offers related to robotics from MIT, University of Washington, University of Virginia, and University of Minnesota Twin Cities among others. C: What key factors should students consider when planning their graduate applications, especially for top universities like MIT?
 A: There are several key factors, the importance of which I realised even more after becoming a student reviewer for MIT applications this fall. First and foremost are CGPA and research profile. My CGPA was 3.98 on a scale of 4, and to get into top universities, you typically need a strong CGPA to demonstrate long-term dedication. However, you can make up for a lower CGPA with significant research experience, particularly if you've published your work in well-known conferences or journals. It's crucial to have projects and publications in the same domain as your intended programme. In my application, I was able to connect the dots clearly, showing an intermediate level of expertise through hands-on projects like those in the rover challenges, along with a few publications in conferences and journals. All of this showcased my passion for solving complex problems, particularly in robotics. Next, comes the standardised tests. I didn't take the GRE since MIT waived it during my application year, but I did take the IELTS and scored a Band 8, with all sections higher than 7.5. For those preparing, I recommend taking mock tests to ensure readiness and aiming for balanced scores across all sections. Moreover, start building your CV and academic profile early, keeping them concise and organised. Your statement of purpose (SOP) and letters of recommendation (LoRs) are vital for piecing together your profile. They present your unique story and align your research interests with the programme. Engaging in projects with faculty members and maintaining strong relationships with them will help you organically identify the right people to write strong LoRs, which are absolutely crucial. Lastly, extracurricular activities (ECAs) round out your application, showing versatility. I had a moderate ECA profile, working as a lecturer and being a founder of several teams that secured over USD 200,000 in funding, which demonstrated my commitment to STEM and community service. Reaching out to professors is also a key part of the process. I had interviews with professors from five of the nine universities I applied to before the application deadlines, thanks to targeted outreach. C: How important were standardized tests like GRE and IELTS in your admission process? A: I would like to address one of the misconceptions that students have: GRE and IELTS aren't the primary focus for admission; instead, they objectively compare applicants coming from different curricula and demonstrate English proficiency and problem-solving skills, especially for non-native speakers. C: How do you see your research impacting future technologies in Bangladesh and around the globe as well? A: My research aims to develop algorithms to facilitate a future where robots not only perform tasks but also intelligently adapt to new tasks in uncertain environments through morphological reconfiguration. I envision this technology having significant potential in extraterrestrial exploration, deep ocean research, drug delivery and internal surgery in healthcare, and emergency disaster response – sectors where uncertainty is high, and deploying multiple systems is less efficient than utilising a reconfigurable robot. I aim to build upon the expertise gained during my PhD by expanding my research into new areas, focusing on enhancing the capability and flexibility of robotic systems. Beside my core focus in research, I am eager to contribute to developing effective AI solutions like warehouse automation and control policies for autonomous vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in Bangladesh. I look forward to collaborating with more roboticists in Bangladesh and leveraging my expertise to develop solutions that reduce the need for manual labor. C: What is your vision for the job industry and robotics? A: The demand for robotics expertise is set to skyrocket globally, including in Bangladesh, over the next two decades. While still a niche field here, major companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta already have significant robotics R&D sectors. Examples include Meta's touch-sensitive robotics skin, which aids in the construction of the Metaverse, and Tesla's humanoid robot Optimus (Gen-2). C: How is academic life at MIT different from here and why are they so advanced in research? A: Academic life at MIT differs greatly from that in Bangladesh due to abundant resources and a focus on passion-driven projects. Students have access to a wide array of human and computational resources that nurture innovation. The environment is nearly non-judgmental, allowing for stress-free idea development, while resources are shared in a controlled manner to support promising initiatives. MIT invests heavily in its PhD students, viewing them as valuable assets. This includes providing support for academic challenges and addressing administrative issues like visa and financial concerns. This holistic approach significantly contributes to their advanced research capabilities. I am very grateful to have such a wonderful opportunity to pursue an interesting research topic. C: As an MIT PhD student and a MIST alumnus, what advice would you give to aspiring international students in Bangladesh? A: My favorite quote from the movie Turbo is, ""No dream is too big, and no dreamer is too small."" Keep your dream alive by working hard and nurturing your inner inquisitive spirit along the way. I believe the fear of failure is the biggest enemy when it comes to taking risks in such a competitive academic environment in Bangladesh. I would encourage people to still take risks and follow their passion wholeheartedly. Not every voyage will lead to success, but each journey will teach you valuable lessons. And one day, you might look back and smile, realising that every step was necessary for the dots to connect perfectly.  Fatima Ashraf is a Campus Ambassador for The Daily Star from the Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST).","Wed Dec 11, 2024 06:22 PM         Last update on: Wed Dec 11, 2024 10:07 PM"

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/education/news/risking-lives-attend-classes-3442526","Risking lives to attend classes","Arifa Khatun, a fourth-grader at Bostal Government Primary School in Sujanagar upazila of Pabna, has to travel to school using a boat every day, leaving her family concerned for her safety. Her 3-year-old sister, Jamila Khatun, drowned early last month while taking a ride on a boat. Since then, the family has become terrified of the perils of monsoon. ""Since my sister drowned, my parents are always anxious about sending me to school on a boat alone. However, there is no alternative. Otherwise, I'd end up missing a lot of classes,"" said Arifa. The school, located in the Gaznar Beel in the upazila, remains submerged for around half a year from monsoon onward, compelling teachers and students to use boats to attend classes. Visiting the school recently, this correspondent himself had to reach the school building on a boat. He also saw many students rowing boats to go to the school. Riya Khatun, a student, said she has to pay Tk 150 to a boatman every month to get to the school. Yet, most days she is late as the boat takes time to take her there. As a result, the school has long been facing a downturn in class attendance. Of the 65 students, only around half could manage to show up in the classes. ""The government founded this school in 2014 as the first in the village. Since the beginning, we have been struggling to get students,"" said Md Momin Uddin, headteacher of the school. Now there are three schools in Gaznar Beel area, all being submerged and facing lack of students due to poor accessibility. When visiting Sharir Vita Government Primary School in the area, this correspondent saw a similar scenario. Many students were seen attending classes in wet clothes. ""We commute to school by boat, and it usually rains in the morning. So, we get drenched on our way here,"" said Rohit Khan, a sixth-grader at the school. Masura Khatun, a seventh-grader, said, ""Sometimes we even fall off the boat and get wet. Thankfully, most of us know how to swim. But our parents are worried for our safety nevertheless."" Headteacher Shahidul Islam said the school has been submerged since the end of June and will likely remain so till mid-November. Out of 238 students, only 120-150 students manage to attend classes regularly during this period, he added. Headteachers of both schools demanded permanent boat facilities from the government so that teachers and students can arrive on time and return home safely. There are around 550 students admitted to the three schools in the area, according to education office sources. Abdul Zabbar, upazila primary education officer, said, ""Three out of 145 primary schools in Sujanagar upazila -- Sharir Vita, Bostal, and Paikpara -- remain submerged for around five to six months, making it difficult to conduct academic activities."" ""Of the three schools, Bostal and Sharir Vita are most affected. We have asked teachers from these schools to encourage parents and students so that academic activities are not disrupted,"" said Zabbar. Asked about the demand for arranging boats for the affected schools, the official said they have already submitted a proposal in this regard. ""If we get funds from the government, we will arrange boats for teachers and students of the schools,"" he added.","Sat Oct 14, 2023 12:00 AM         Last update on: Tue Oct 17, 2023 08:34 PM"

The new show had big shoes to fill, and for the most part, it succeeds in being a worthy continuation of the original show with a stellar storyline, well-developed characters and brutal action sequences. The story takes place several years after the ending of the original series. Matt Murdock, having abandoned his superhero identity, is compelled to return when Wilson Fisk (The Kingpin) becomes New York's mayor and begins a conspiracy to outlaw masked vigilantes while expanding his criminal empire. Before starting the critical analysis, it is important to note that halfway through production, the show went through a complete creative overhaul. Essentially, before the show had fewer connections both in terms of tone and storyline to the previous series. They included previously completed episodes but also added new content that connected it to the Netflix series. The show's resulting mixture of two different visions is apparent, with episodes clearly distinguishable as pre- and post-overhaul. The weakest parts of the show are the pre-overhaul episodes. While it starts off solid, the plot progresses very slowly, with Matt not suiting up as Daredevil for quite a long time. The newer supporting characters are not as nuanced or likeable as Foggy Nelson and Karen Page from the original series, and it is even more evident when those characters eventually show up here. They introduced a new villain named Muse, who began as an intriguing character, but unfortunately, his arc did not live up to its potential. However, other new characters like the superhero White Tiger and Daniel Blake, Fisk's protégé, were genuinely interesting and added depth to the narrative. That being said, the rest of the show proves why Charlie Cox's Daredevil remains arguably the best-written hero in the MCU. His rivalry and dynamic with Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin continues to be iconic, and the expert cinematography and visual storytelling of the scenes just add icing on the cake to their respective character arcs. Returning characters such as Benjamin Poindexter (Bullseye) and Frank Castle (The Punisher) have their own mini-arcs that further add tension and nuance to the story. Despite the slow build, the character development and overall narrative make the show amazing. The major problem with MCU heroes, such as the Avengers, is that they seldom deal with ""real"" problems that affect everyday people. They're always fighting aliens, monsters, or a threat to the planet or multiverse, and the movies focus heavily on massive CGI battles rather than showing the heroes actually ""save"" civilians. Daredevil actually deals with grounded issues, and this show in particular parallels real-world issues of corrupt people becoming politicians and exploiting average citizens. Besides the obvious parallel between Fisk's election and Trump's presidency, an interesting plot point is also featured where corrupt cops use the Punisher's logo to commit murders, reflecting the real-world misuse of the symbol by American police and far-right white supremacists. Despite a few weaknesses, like the pacing issues and inconsistent episode quality, Daredevil: Born Again is a fantastic show with compelling characters, a narrative that strays away from the standard superhero fare in favour of realistic world building. It is undoubtedly one of the best projects in the MCU in the past few years, and a worthy follow-up to the fan-favourite Netflix show.","Sat May 17, 2025 03:17 PM         Last update on: Sat May 17, 2025 03:28 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/the-lives-international-medical-students-bangladesh-3894586","The lives of international medical students in Bangladesh","Many of us have thought of pursuing a degree abroad. If we were to set aside the practical aspects of this process and instead shift our focus on to the emotional toll that it takes on a student, we would notice phases of excitement mixed with dashes of fear and anxiety. Excitement because the student would get to experience a whole new country – all on their own – possibly for the first time in their life. Fear precisely because they would be in a whole new country, all alone, thousands of miles away from their loved ones. It could be one of the most unique experiences in a student's life. Now imagine if the country the student is flying into was Bangladesh. Many of the universities in Bangladesh have foreign students studying a range of subjects. But by far, the degree most foreign students come to pursue is a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). Currently, 221 out of 5380 seats are reserved for foreign students in government colleges. In private colleges, a large fraction of the intake can be foreign students. Currently, there are over 10,000 medical students only from India. Students from Pakistan, Nepal, Jammu and Kashmir, and even Palestine come to study MBBS here. To get an overview of their experiences, Campus reached out to a few international students and had them discuss numerous aspects of their lives in Bangladesh. ""Everything about leaving your country and your comfort zone and moving to a different part of the world is challenging. A big challenge is adjusting to the environment and culture,"" said Isaaq N Namoura, A fifth-year student from Palestine studying at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College. ""There's a language barrier present here. When I started off, I didn't know that classes would be in Bangla. I didn't get to take a Bangla course when I first came over. English was challenging too as it isn't my first language, and neither is it for my teachers'. So, we struggled to communicate a lot in the beginning. Now that I've learned Bangla though, conversing has become much easier. However, the curriculum should definitely include an introductory course in Bangla,"" he added. Another student from Assam, Angela Shirin, studying at Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College said, ""MBBS is tough, and being away from home, especially when you see your mates going home every weekend, is super hard. For instance, if I get homesick right now, I need to cross an entire country to go home. And the hardest part is you never know if things at home are going to be the same as when you left. The constant fear and worry about my family take a toll on me. Among the challenges I've had to overcome and adapt to, the climate ranks number one. It's way too hot and humid out here. The language barrier had been a problem, but with time I got a handle on it. All you need to do is learn these words: mama, baam pashe, daan pashe, shomosshha nai."" When asked about her clinical experience and interacting with patients, she said, ""I remember a humorous interaction where I was asked to palpate the liver of a middle-aged man. I struggled to ask him to move his shirt aside. I blurted out something close in Bangla, but the patient didn't quite understand what I was trying to say. He proceeded to reply in a different dialect perhaps, but I couldn't grasp it. So, I acted out what I wanted him to do, which was when he finally understood."" ""I think the Bangla word for lung is very funny. I chuckle a bit every time I come across a patient with some lung pathology,"" she added. Having a social life, making friends, or finding job opportunities for some extra cash is made difficult not only by the language barrier but by the cultural barrier as well. Settling into hostel culture and interacting with locals poses its own set of challenges. Regarding this, Isaaq said, ""The whole new experience, the whole new set of regulations, culture, and people is exciting to me. The other thing I didn't even realise is I'd enjoy electricity and running water 24/7. This isn't a privilege we always have in Palestine. So, it really provides some much-needed perspective."" Naveed Shahrier, a final-year student from Kashmir said, ""Managing your social life is something that isn't addressed enough. It starts with your hostel roommates and batch mates. Often, what begins as congenial friendships grow colder over time. Most of the time, you feel a burden of loneliness. It's a situation that cannot be easily communicated to someone who hasn't experienced being in a foreign land."" He also spoke about the availability of job opportunities for foreign students, ""If you see a Kashmiri in the streets of Dhaka, he's either a shawl vendor selling our renowned shawls or a medical student studying in a private medical college. For pocket money, a few foreign students have found a niche as social media influencers. It's apparently a good source of income. One of my juniors, Abhishek Jajariya, a Rajasthani third-year student, has been doing inspirational work. He's cashing in six figures a month providing online tutoring to junior students and acting as a consultant. Besides this, many students vlog about their experience here and get endorsement deals. Many Kashmiris are also sought by modelling agencies to pose for local brands."" As for the quality of education and cooperation from faculty members, Angela remarked that faculty members from her college have been friendly and considerate. ""They always consider granting us additional leave, empathise with us, and also understand the difficulties of living so far from home for long stretches,"" she said. Looking back at the tumultuous times of the July uprising in 2024, she explained, ""I was really touched (by the faculty members' conduct) when chaos built up in Bangladesh last year. All colleges were shut down and we were stuck here. A few of the teachers were really concerned and made sure we got home safely. In addition, we addressed our concerns about not resuming classes right away."" ""Not only were they considerate enough to postpone the items (daily viva exams) till we arrived but also assured us that we could take the exams online or when we came back to Bangladesh, if we missed it. I have always openly shared my problems, be it personal or academic, with some of the teachers, and they have always been helpful,"" she said. Although Bangladesh welcomes a considerable number of medical students every year, there still remains a lot to account for if we truly want to be a hub for medical education. The Directorate General for Health Services (DGHS), for instance, could take steps to improve the experience of foreign students pursuing an MBBS degree in Bangladesh.  Munna Yadav, a student from Nepal at Dhaka Medical College said, ""Bangladesh is a prime destination for medical education, as there is good clinical exposure here with high patient flow. Yet some hurdles persist. Foreign students doing internships at government medical colleges do not receive any compensation. Some private colleges do pay, but there is a lack of uniformity there as well."" ""Besides, private medical colleges don't provide enough information about their institutions online or in circulars, which makes the process of direct admission tough. It also forces many to rely on consultancies. The country often goes through spells of political turmoil but there is no government body or special unit from the DGHS to counsel or reassure foreign students about their safety. These issues are holding this sector back and need to be addressed,"" he elaborated. Prof. Md Mustafizur Rahman, former Vice-Principal of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College, stated that Bangladesh is a hub for medical education in South Asia due to the quality of education being offered, exposure to a broad spectrum of clinical cases, and the low cost at which the education is being offered. However, there is still room for improvement.  ""Our faculty members are very conscious about the needs of international students, even more so than our domestic students sometimes because we acknowledge international students may have a hard time fitting in here and naturally may require closer attention and care. Yes, we have space for improvement when it comes to accommodation and one-stop services for these students. We hope by incorporating these facilities in the future, Bangladesh will secure its place as an ideal destination for medical education,"" he said. As things stand, we are offering quality medical education at a competitive price compared to the global market. However, a unified and transparent approach to the admission process for foreign nationals, which would be applicable to all medical colleges, is of utmost necessity. Special counsellors also have to be assigned by the DGHS for any emergency needs the students may have. And though the medium of education will remain in English, incorporating an introductory Bangla language course for foreign students will go a long way in helping them interact with patients better. The place where one completes their undergraduate becomes a second home of sorts. With that in mind, it should be our holistic goal to provide these individuals – who have left their homelands to study in our medical colleges – a standardised academic experience as well as an amiable social experience.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/are-late-night-study-sessions-effective-3894621","Are late night study sessions effective?","As the world drifts into slumber, the quiet symphony of flickering desk lamps and rustling pages accompanies the solitary student studying late into the night. The solitude of the silent hours sets the stage for nocturnal study sessions, where late-night reading and practice tests replace sleep. Students regularly pull all-nighters as a coping mechanism to deal with the horrors of academic pressure. Whether a dedicated night owl or a last-minute crammer, staying up late to study is a staple of the student experience for all. The appeal of night-time studying often stems from necessity rather than preference. Daytime usually pass in juggling class schedules and extra-curriculars, with most students finding it challenging to allocate sufficient time for self-evaluation. Thus, as burning the midnight oil to catch up on coursework starts looking like a fair exchange, sleep transforms into a luxury that feels almost unattainable. However, do late-night study sessions truly offer the environment conducive to learning and self-evaluation that individuals desire? For many, studying during the night is their only option. The importance of comfortable, personal study spaces is undeniable; however, many students don't have access to these spaces. For instance, growing up in overcrowded households usually means there is an absence of quiet corners so maintaining focus turns into a constant battle against distractions. For those living in bustling metropolitans, their ability to concentrate is compromised by incessant vehicular noises and chaotic clutter. As a response, many turn to late-night studying as a final resort. According to research conducted at the University of Notre Dame, people who stay up late perform better in terms of memory retention. This phenomenon is attributed to what experts call 'retroactive interference'. Studying during the daytime leads to interruptions and the continual influx of new information which increases the likelihood of forgetting previously learned material. The brain can understand information more efficiently before sleep, enhancing the ability to recall important details. Furthermore, people with short attention spans and those who depend on last-minute work for their exams sometimes find themselves performing better during the after-hours. The adrenaline rush of working against a deadline heightens motivation, turning procrastination into a driving force for productivity. When exam seasons loom, many students rely on cramming overnight to get by. However, studying during odd hours comes with significant health risks, primarily rooted in a lack of sleep disrupting a person's biological clock. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to long-term health problems. Research shows that consistently staying up late affects the body's circadian rhythms, which regulate sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and metabolism. Over time, this disruption can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and weakened immune function. Sleep deprivation also takes a toll on mental health. Missing out on sleep temporarily boosts dopamine levels, constructing a feeling of short-term euphoria. This short-lived high can impair decision-making and lead to impulsive behaviour. For students who constantly rely on studying during the night, these effects may accumulate and lead to a decrease in overall academic performance and well-being. Despite offering a short-term solution, studying past midnight often leads to diminished productivity throughout the following day. Lack of sleep makes it harder to build focus during classes, retain new information, or participate fully in academic discussions. As a result, students may find themselves trapped in a cycle of exhaustion, where they are constantly catching up but failing to get ahead. With the fleeting benefits of late-night studying weighed against its lasting toll, the question remains: is it a sustainable practice? The choice narrows down to whether the short bursts of focus at night are worth the long-term consequences. For those who feel trapped by the chaos of daytime, one approach could be shifting study hours to early mornings when thought processes sharpen and the surrounding environment is still calm. Studying in public spaces like libraries or reading cafes can also provide a focused atmosphere without the need to stay up late. Ultimately, the goal is to find a balance supporting both effective learning and overall well-being. References: 1. Notre Dame News (March 23, 2012).

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/education/news/should-you-consider-pursuing-online-degree-3894601","Should you consider pursuing an online degree?","At present, online degrees are becoming more an attractive option to many students, especially to those looking for flexibility and affordability. While this mode of higher education is still new in Bangladesh, it is slowly drawing attention. Online degrees offer the freedom to study from anywhere, often at a fraction of the cost needed to pursue the same degrees in person from traditional universities. More importantly, they let you gain real-world experience while still in university. We reached out to three students, all of whom have experience in pursuing online degrees, to hear what they have to say about this mode of higher studies. Faizah Lubaba Shristy, who began her online degree in Computer Science at the University of the People, said, ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, most public and private university admission exams in Bangladesh were suspended. Besides, the tuition fees for a Computer Science degree were high, and I did not want to take out a loan that could lead to financial strain. I had good grades and a clear goal to earn a degree that would help me pursue meaningful work or entrepreneurial ventures in Bangladesh."" Sharmin Akter Jany had studied Management at a university in China for two years before the pandemic changed her plans. ""A friend recommended that I consider an online degree. Studying in Bangladesh would have meant starting over and spending another four years at university. In contrast, online education was a more efficient and practical solution for me, as a four-year degree can be completed in as little as two and a half years."" Prasun Bipra, who is attending an online BSc programme in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, said, ""I chose the degree because Data Science, which I wanted to pursue, is not widely available as a major in Bangladesh. Also, it gives me a lot of flexibility to learn at my own pace while maintaining other commitments."" For all three students, affordability and time are major factors as to why they opted for an online degree. Regarding the affordability aspect, Bipra said, ""My degree costs roughly around BDT 4.5 lakh. The fee is paid in instalments, so I do not feel much pressure."" Jany enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, consisting of 40 courses, at the University of the People. ""Each course usually costs around USD 120. There is a USD 60 admission fee, but sometimes it is waived. I was fortunate to receive a full scholarship from the beginning, so I did not have to pay anything at all."" Scholarship support also motivated Shristy to continue her degree. ""We only pay an exam fee and there are no admin or book fees. I received scholarships which covered most of my tuition fees. The total cost of my degree was around BDT 5 lakh, but because of scholarships, I paid around BDT 1 lakh in total for my full degree. Students have the scope to secure 70 to 80 percent scholarships in some online degree programmes if they can write a strong admission essay."" Apart from affordability, the flexibility offered in such online programmes is unparalleled. Traditional in-person classes see students spending hours commuting to and from their universities. For those pursuing a degree abroad, the logistics are even more difficult – from relocating to a different country to adjusting to the culture there. Besides, in-person classes also restrict students from attending to other activities, including part-time work. The flexibility of online education, however, eliminates most, if not all, of these problems. As the classes can be attended from anywhere remotely, the need to commute, relocate, or sacrifice part-time work opportunities is no longer necessary. Besides, as Shristy points out, students are granted free access to various premium tools and resources that help them with their courses as well as academics in general. The faculty members' diversity in these online programmes also add value to the studies. ""Our faculty members come from around the globe like India, the US, Africa, the Middle East, and so on. As our university is accredited by WASC – the same prestigious body that accredits Stanford – the standards are world-class,"" said Shristy. Adding to this, Sharmin said, ""The teachers are very supportive. If I ever receive lower marks, I can talk to them and they will look into the matter fairly. We also have a personal programme advisor who responds to our queries within one to two days."" An online degree does not mean the academic standards are any lower. Apart from being accredited by various councils and institutions, the faculty members at these programmes maintain integrity and stick to certain standards. ""Teachers mark according to detailed rubrics, and any shortcuts, like using AI incorrectly, can result in academic misconduct. Everything has to follow proper APA citation rules, and only scholarly, reputable references are accepted,"" said Shristy. All that being said, online learning comes with its own challenges. ""Staying motivated while studying online takes a personal commitment to excellence,"" said Shristy. ""I know deadlines are coming, and with no room for extensions, I have to approach my work with dedication and perfection. There's no second chance – if you miss a week, you fall behind."" Bipra added to this, saying, ""While you can study from anywhere, online degrees also require a lot of self-discipline and time management since there are fewer face-to-face reminders or interactions with teachers."" Besides, when it comes to online degrees or education, concerns surrounding isolation and missing out on campus life are always there. ""At first, I did feel a sense of isolation, wondering if I was missing out on the traditional university experience,"" said Shristy. ""But over time, my priorities shifted. I needed to work, not just to be another graduate in Bangladesh, but to truly grow. I gained real-world experience, explored fellowship programmes, and also ran a business that funded my education. By my fourth year of studies, I had no regrets."" Bipra pointed out another drawback, ""What I hate is the complete lack of interaction with the institution offline. Students might feel a bit isolated because they do not meet classmates in person, and group activities or discussions can feel less engaging through a screen."" He added, ""In-person university offers a more traditional experience where students go to a campus, attend live lectures, and meet their classmates and teachers face-to-face. It is easier to make friends, ask questions immediately, and join clubs or events. The environment feels more social and active."" Despite the isolating academic experience, people pursuing such online programmes manage to find community in their own way, as was the case with Jany. ""Even though we do not have the traditional campus life, it never felt like anything was missing. We build connections virtually through peer discussions, private messages, and feedback on assignments."" The shift to online learning also transformed how they approach education. Shristy now follows a fixed routine, usually studying from Thursday night to Saturday night. Jany, on the other hand, believes that online learning made her more disciplined and helped improve her research and time management skills. Still, a major challenge remains, which is perception. ""Some people still think online degrees are not real or that you did not earn them properly,"" said Shristy. ""But I was lucky to work with people who understand how times are changing."" Shristy did face some pushback. ""I did have one tough experience, where an interview for a role questioned my online degree, and they seemed shocked by it."" Despite that, Shristy went on to do an internship at Chaldal and is now working there full-time as a product operations associate. Bipra too believes that online education has a strong future, but not without limits. Jany agrees with this, saying that attitudes need to change. According to her, many people still do not understand how structured or credible online education is. But once they learn more about it, their opinion usually changes.","Wed May 14, 2025 07:21 PM         Last update on: Wed May 14, 2025 07:26 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/mom-sense-the-logic-i-only-began-understand-after-i-turned-20-3892261","Mom-sense: The logic I only began to understand after I turned 20","Growing up, I was convinced my mom had a personal vendetta against fun. Late nights? Banned. Junk food? Dream on. Spontaneous outings? Only if they involved groceries. Screen time? Monitored like a national security threat. But somehow, the older I got, the more I realised those no's weren't roadblocks; they were safety nets. Back then, it felt unfair. While my friends lived the best life—junk food, sleepovers, Netflix marathons—I was indoors doing homework under the watchful eyes of General Mom. I called it ""house arrest"". She called it ""parenting"". But here's the thing I didn't realise until much later: she wasn't trying to ruin my life; she was trying to shape it. While I saw restrictions, she saw protection. While I sulked about rules, she was silently building me a future where I'd thank her for every ""no"" she ever said. But with time, things changed. One day, curious about her sudden chill mode, I asked why she wasn't as strict anymore. She looked at me with that knowing smile and said, ""There's a time for everything."" No long explanation; just one of those quiet truths she always seems to carry in her back pocket. We expect mothers to be superhuman. Warmth on demand, food on the table, patience always stocked, and a smile through every chaos. But we forget – this is her first time too. She is figuring things out as she goes, making mistakes, getting back up, and doing it all over again. Coming to working moms? Absolute legends. They clock out of the office and clock into their second job without flinching. Stay-at-home moms? Equally heroic, running homes like CEOs, minus the bonuses and coffee breaks. Society often praises what it can see – promotions, paychecks, performance reviews. But motherhood is measured in lullabies sung through exhaustion, meals cooked without complaint, lessons taught through patience, and love given endlessly, even when none is returned. To every mother – whether you're balancing board meetings and baby bottles, or spending your days running a home that never pauses – you are more than enough. And my mom? She juggled both roles. She worked a full-time job and still made time for spelling tests, fever checks, surprise Tupperware hunts, and emotional therapy sessions disguised as dinner chats. I, of course, still found reasons to complain – cold food, a house not organised, and clothes not ironed (my own fault, but still). So if you ever wonder what a superhero looks like—don't look up. Look home. She's probably in the kitchen reheating your food... again. So, here's to the unsung hero in every home. To every mother – who makes love look easy, patience look endless, and multitasking look magical. Because let's face it—if motherhood were a paid job, no company could afford the salary.","Sun May 11, 2025 07:37 PM         Last update on: Sun May 11, 2025 07:47 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/education/news/struggles-writing-research-paper-undergrad-3892156","Struggles of writing a research paper as an undergrad","Have you ever started a research paper with a head full of ideas only to hit a wall mid-way? This is a common experience for many undergrads writing their first research paper. What begins as an exciting dive into a topic can quickly devolve into a frustrating maze of tedious work. Even though the end result is rewarding, the process is filled with roadblocks that might feel insurmountable unless tackled with patience and tact. Struggling with team coordination One of the most challenging aspects of writing a research paper is finding the right team. Initially, teaming up may feel like a brilliant idea — tasks can be easily divided and deadlines seem within reach! But soon you realise it's not that simple. Clashing schedules, different work ethics, and last-minute panics quickly turn what was supposed to be a group effort into a source of stress. To avoid these pitfalls, set clear goals from the beginning, maintain a shared calendar to keep everyone on track, and arrange regular meetings to keep everyone accountable and organised. Difficulty in finding study participants Research relies on valid data, responses from survey findings, or interviews. While reaching out to people for these surveys and interviews, however, oftentimes emails sit unnoticed, messages get ignored, and forms remain incomplete. The clock keeps ticking but you keep not being able to find enough research participants to meet your data requirements. At some point, you start wondering; ""Will I have enough responses to complete this research on time?"" To increase participation and gather sufficient data, diversify your network and cast a wide net through social media, offer incentives to participants, and send follow-up reminders to ensure a timely submission of responses. Facing writer's block Your participants are ready, your research topic is on track, and the deadline is set. But then the dreaded writer's block creeps in. Ideas buzz in your mind, yet the words refuse to take shape and you end up staring at a blank page for hours on end. Every researcher knows this struggle — it's as if a battle is being waged in your mind between thoughts and words while time keeps slipping away. To get the words flowing, outline your thoughts in bullet points before expanding them into paragraphs. Discussing your ideas with a peer may also be the catalyst you need to spark creativity. The challenge of understanding unfamiliar topics Writing a paper becomes more challenging when tackling a topic you know little about. Starting a paper on an unfamiliar topic can be overwhelming in and of itself; limited online resources for primary research can further complicate this process. Although this obstacle is manageable over time and with effort, the initial lack of knowledge often feels like a significant hurdle, making it difficult to know where to begin. To understand your topic clearly, reach out to professors or experts and form study groups with classmates who have a stronger grasp of the topic and can share valuable insights and resources. Formatting and citation Citations are far more than a formality in academic writing. They are necessary for maintaining academic integrity and safeguarding against plagiarism. The problem with this final part of the paper begins with understanding the different styles of citation — APA, MLA, Chicago, and more. From punctuation placement to italicisation, the slightest mistake can undermine the credibility of an otherwise well-organised paper. Moreover, the fear of plagiarism looms large — forgetting to cite a source can have serious academic consequences. To keep track of your sources and ensure correct formatting, use citation management tools online or consult with a librarian to ensure accuracy. The pressure of balancing research with coursework A good paper needs constant effort to make progress. However, just when you think you are making progress, a string of assignments, project work, and quizzes pile up at your university. The constant switch between tasks makes it difficult to focus and research often gets sidelined. Finding a balanced routine to prioritise academics without neglecting your research becomes hard. To reduce the pressure, employ time management techniques like the Pomodoro method, which breaks work down into 25-minute intervals with short breaks, to enhance focus. If needed, discuss workload management with academic advisors to find a balanced approach. The entire research process can lead to burnout with you constantly doubting your every effort. However, it is important to see these obstacles as part of the learning process. Each struggle is a chance to build critical thinking abilities and time management skills. And, in the end, it all feels worthwhile when you finally see your work getting published and gaining recognition from your peers.  Nusrat Meherin Faiza is a writer, tutor, and chronic overthinker.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/how-the-us-funding-cuts-are-affecting-international-graduate-students-3889106","How the US funding cuts are affecting international graduate students","Academia in the US has been severely shaken after the second term of the Trump administration began in January. From federal funding cuts to demands for policy changes, many universities have been hit hard, with international students feeling the brunt of the effects. Many US federal agencies have had their funds slashed or have been ordered to be slashed or frozen, including the National Institute of Health (NIH) which funds portions of medical research in many research institutions nationwide. This has, in turn, led to research grants being cut or threatened to be cut for many universities in the US, causing major layoffs and jeopardising research in the medical field, climate sciences, and social sciences. The Trump administration has been actively leveraging the NIH funding to force US universities to change their policies regarding Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and pro-Palestine sentiments on campus. As a result, universities are having to shrink department sizes, reduce student intake, slash funding for students, and even rescind offer letters. This has created immense uncertainty for current and prospective international students, who already face more barriers than domestic students, and may have far-reaching consequences for the future of academia. ""Despite their prestige, US schools feel increasingly inaccessible. It's hard to commit to a programme when financial uncertainty constantly looms over the experience,"" says Anika Tabassum Amreen, a US graduate school applicant. Higher education in the US is notorious for being incredibly expensive, more so for international students, but this was alleviated by the generous scholarships given by US schools. However, now that those scholarships are far fewer in number due to funding cuts, they have become much less reliable. Students who had hoped for these scholarships to fund their higher education now face the unprecedented challenge of navigating other ways of securing funding. While domestic students can still work and pay for their tuition, international students don't enjoy the same freedom. ""As an international student, employment is restricted to on-campus jobs, making the search even more challenging,"" says Amreen. Furthermore, graduate assistantships and other on-campus opportunities can be highly competitive, making them inaccessible to most students.  So what other choice are international students left with? Not much. Financial burdens and visa uncertainties are leading many to reconsider the US as their study destination. ""I am not going to be prioritising US programmes for the time being until there is more clarity regarding the situation surrounding higher education there,"" says Hamza Mohammed, a prospective PhD student, who had initially intended to study in the US but is now considering other regions as well, such as Europe. Many students applying to US schools have also reported that their admissions or scholarships were rescinded. ""Cornell is trying to make sure the current students have secured funding before taking in new students,"" says Nabila Nawar Binti, a graduate research assistant at Cornell University. More than one billion USD in funding for Cornell was frozen according to the White House. While it is only right that universities prioritise supporting their already existing students before they can fund incoming ones, this puts prospective students at a disadvantage as it makes admission and securing scholarships that much more difficult. ""Two of the universities where I had obtained funding informed me that they will no longer be able to provide the promised funding due to cuts to their research budgets,"" says Hamza. As the US is the premier study destination for students around the world, this will certainly put the academic aspirations of many international students in jeopardy. The funding cuts are not only affecting prospective students in the US but also current ones. ""A lot of the students who expected funding were still doing rotations when they found out about the cuts, so they had to find additional rotations while their funding was frozen,"" says Nabila. Rotations are short research experiences, usually spanning a few weeks, that graduate students cycle through in order to gain experience and find which research areas are best suited for them. Having to do more lab rotations, because the funding for their own research got frozen, spells delays for these students' own research work, which is a significant hurdle for students who want to complete their degrees in a timely manner. Universities themselves have also been struggling to manage, with massive damage being done to research efforts. Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors, told The Guardian, ""Members of mine are having to lay people off and having to close their labs. It's been a complete, utter, destruction of the United States research infrastructure."" This not only affects students' education but also on-campus employment opportunities for current students, as many international students rely on research assistant and teaching assistant positions to pay for their tuition. If laid off, they will be left without this support, and the financial burden may become unbearable. The Trump administration's demand for scrapping DEI programmes that supported underrepresented and underprivileged groups can also have a significant impact on international students. An example of DEI programmes that support international students is the International Mentoring Program at Brown University which pairs incoming international students with mentors from within the student body to guide them in academic and social matters. Another example is the Associated Students of the University of Washington (ASUW), a student association at the University of Washington which provides students identity-based support, access to legislative advocacy, and inclusive programming. If the DEI scrapping measures target programmes and organisations such as this, international students will be left at a disadvantage. The administration also demanded that institutions change their admission processes ""to prevent admitting international students hostile to the American values"", without clearly specifying what is exactly meant by ""American values"". This is certain to harm many international students from around the world, whose academic careers could be harmed by such arbitrary notions. Additionally, the government's demands that universities must report students engaged in political protests and overhaul their campus protest policies in order to address ""anti-semitism"" will not only negatively impact many current students but also deter many international students from applying to American universities in the near future.  Columbia University has yielded to many of the administration's demands, in hopes of restoring funding worth USD 400 million. On the other hand, Harvard University has refused to budge despite threats of massive funding cuts, with its president Alan Garber asserting Harvard's commitment to autonomy as a private institution. Following Harvard's lead, a collective of other elite schools have joined forces to combat the demands made by the Trump administration, with their leaders reportedly having discussions on how to effectively resist said demands. Other prominent universities, such as Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Michigan, have also been targeted by the administration. At this point, it is a lose-lose situation for international students, because if the universities yield to the demands, it will make higher education a lot more tumultuous for them as the DEI measures will have to be scrapped, they will be scrutinised more heavily during the admission process, and there will be a looming threat of losing funding should the universities accept more of the Trump administration's whims in the future. However, if the universities decide to resist instead, they will probably have much less money at their disposal, thus many international students will be left without funding or even admission offers. International students make invaluable contributions towards research in the US. Thus, considering the difficulties they face now and are likely to continue facing under the current administration, the future of American graduate education looks grim. With a smaller pool of researchers, a shrunken budget, and the general volatility of the political climate, a perfect storm beckons over the horizon. ""Not only budget cuts, but visa revocation of many international students in recent times, along with some other probable policy changes will grossly impact the future of graduate education,"" says Dr Tanvir R Faisal, an assistant professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. On top of all this chaos, the visa application process is already mired with a great deal of uncertainty. Even if you get offered admission and somehow manage to secure sufficient funding, there is always the possibility that your visa will be rejected and your dreams of attending graduate school in the US will be shattered. This is nothing new, but it piles up with all the other obstacles that prospective international students are facing. It is still difficult to tell exactly how detrimental the Trump administration's actions will be to academia, but there is no doubt that they will be severe. And yet, hope cannot be lost, and there are practical measures that can be taken to mitigate the onslaught of funding cuts. According to Dr Faisal, ""One possible option is (for universities) to negotiate with state legislators to increase state-level funding, increase industrial ties for funding, and discuss/raise the issues with congressmen/~women and senators of respective states/congressional districts to reinstate or increase the federal budget for higher education."" Needless to say, the recent measures taken by US President Trump have caught the world of academia off guard, especially international students. Arguably, they are feeling the worst of the effects, from slashed funding to fewer opportunities to even being targeted by authorities. Only time will tell how much longer these conditions will persist, and much will depend on how university authorities decide to tackle the administration's demands and what they do to counteract them.

At a press conference held outside the RUCSU building at 1:00pm today, they called for the list to be published within three days, warning that failure to do so would be viewed as an attempt to sabotage the polls. They demanded that only students enrolled at Rajshahi University up to April 28, 2025, be included in the list and called for strict adherence to the previously announced election roadmap, including setting a specific date for the vote. The group also asked the RUCSU Election Commission to announce the election schedule within seven days following consultations with stakeholders. They urged the university administration to restrict the entry of outsiders and motorcycles to ensure campus security. In their written statement, the former coordinators alleged that different administrative wings of the university were showing reluctance and raising doubts about the election. While a roadmap has been declared, they said it was not being followed. They pointed out that the election code of conduct was supposed to be issued on April 13 and the draft voter list on April 28 — neither of which had been fulfilled. The delay, they claimed, appeared deliberate and raised questions about the administration's intent, undermining students' trust in the process. They believe the confrontational stance of political parties in recent days is disrupting the academic environment and creating security concerns on campus. Responding to a reporter's question, former coordinator Mehedi Sajeeb said, ""We are not naming anyone directly, but if there had been no obstruction, the draft voter list would have been published on time. The administration announced a date but is now making excuses. The Election Commission hasn't even held a single meeting."" He said the lack of initiative suggested an absence of will within the university authorities. ""Had there been genuine interest, Rajshahi University could have led the way in reviving student union elections in the country,"" he said. On whether the suspension of the Rajshahi University Alumni Association (RUAA) election might affect RUCSU, he said, ""RUAA involves former students, while RUCSU is for current ones. But the way the RUAA election was stopped gives rise to fears that similar tactics may be applied here. We are linking the two incidents."" Prof Amzad Hossain, the chief election commissioner of the RUCSU election, said he had just returned to Rajshahi and received the relevant letter only a day earlier. ""I was out of Rajshahi for a few days. After returning, I received the letter yesterday. I will soon call everyone and hold a meeting. We are very positive about the RUCSU election,"" he said.","Mon May 5, 2025 04:35 PM         Last update on: Mon May 5, 2025 05:08 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/navigating-business-case-competitions-non-business-student-3886616","Navigating business case competitions as a non-business student","When we think of business case competitions, it probably sounds like something that our marketing-major friends are meant to participate in. But what if you too could solve real-world business problems despite never having attended a finance or marketing class? That's exactly what business case competitions offer – an opportunity to step into the shoes of a strategist, marketer, or consultant, regardless of your academic background. Although it may sound counterintuitive, students from non-business backgrounds can also do well in business case competitions because they bring a unique perspective to the problems that are being solved. What exactly is a business case competition though? Let's say a company presents a real-world challenge: maybe it's figuring out how to expand into a new market, reduce adverse environmental impact, or improve customer engagement. Your team's task is to analyse the problem, brainstorm solutions, and present a strategy within a given deadline. While business knowledge is helpful, it's not a requirement. The best teams combine different skill sets – data analysis, storytelling, critical thinking, and creativity – to come up with effective solutions. Case competitions come in many formats, including sustainability challenges, tech-focused cases, and social impact initiatives, meaning there's something for everyone. ""Business cases are just about finding smart solutions with limited resources, and the best teams aren't made up of just business students. They need people to break down problems, designers to make things visually appealing, and all kinds of perspectives to think outside the box. Business isn't just about theories – it's about practical problem-solving, and that's a skill anyone can develop,"" said Mohammad Shadman Islam, a Computer Science and Engineering student at North South University (NSU) who has been a part of teams that have won and been the finalists at numerous business competitions all over Bangladesh, including HULT Prize at North South University 2023 and 2024, Brand Master 3.0, MindSparks 23, BrandEdge 2025, and many more. However, navigating business case competitions as a non-business student is not without hardships. The first obstacle is the lack of technical knowledge which can make business jargon and industry-specific metrics sound like gibberish. Thus, it is important to learn the basics quickly. Watching YouTube breakdowns of business case competitions, taking free online courses on Coursera or Khan Academy to understand financial statements and strategy frameworks, and reading articles from publications like the Harvard Business Review to familiarise yourself with business language are all effective methods. Adib Muttaki, a Mechanical Engineering student at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET), and the team leader of project PENTABLE, which secured a top-eight finish at the regional finals of the HULT Prize 2024, provided some insight on how to overcome this barrier. ""It is a trial-and-error experience, and persistence is the key. Since we were learning all these concepts as a team, it felt less like a burden and more like a fun challenge. I collected slides from previous competitions, attended workshops, and studied materials covering the basics of business. We learnt from wherever we could. Over time, these concepts started to make sense."" Shadman echoed, ""At first, jumping into a business case competition felt like diving into the deep end of a pool without knowing how to swim. The only strategy I had was 'don't sink'. I wasn't fluent in business lingo, and terms like EBITDA and synergy sounded more like names of alien planets than something I needed to understand. But instead of overthinking it, I approached it like any science student would – identify what I don't know, break it down, and help my learning.""  In addition, limited exposure to business frameworks, like SWOT analysis, Porter's Five Forces, and market segmentation, and competing against business students who have studied these concepts for years can be intimidating. While these may feel like significant drawbacks, there are strategies one could implement to excel at business case competitions. Firstly, it is important to leverage your unique strengths. A psychology student might be able to analyse consumer behaviour more deeply than a business student can. A computer science major might automate a process that others wouldn't even consider. Liberal arts students may be skilled at crafting impactful narratives. The best teams harness these diverse perspectives. ""While I didn't have the business expertise that some of my teammates at Team Roshmalai had, I approached problems in a way that felt natural to me, similar to how I would tackle an engineering problem. My engineering brain naturally broke the problem down like a flowchart: What's the issue? What are the constraints? What's the most efficient solution?"" Shadman added. ""I found that I felt at ease when participating in sustainability-themed competitions because of my background in development economics. Despite being different domains, I participated in these competitions because the idea of sustainability is almost universal across all fields,"" said Ayon Ghosh, a recent Economics graduate of East West University, who has participated in various case competitions as an undergraduate student. ""As engineering students, when we come up with an idea, our first instinct is to test its feasibility in real life, rather than just theorising. For the competition, we didn't just propose a solution – we built a working prototype on campus. With access to resources and guidance from our professors, we could test our ideas and back them up with real-world data. This practical, hands-on approach gave us an edge and helped us stand out in the competition,"" said Adib, when asked if their STEM background had given his team an edge in the competition. Additionally, communication plays a huge role too – stick to simple, clear language when sharing ideas, and steer clear of jargon that might throw people off, which is why working on your presentation skills is essential. This includes making slides, giving an elevator pitch, and speaking about your ideas in a way that conveys the idea clearly and engages the audience. Shadman encourages students who are hesitant to participate in case competitions because of their major to go for it. ""It's actually fun once you stop stressing over fancy business terms and focus on the challenge itself. It's only a matter of time before you realise that case competitions are basically real-life strategy games."" At the end of the day, case competitions aren't just for business majors – they're for anyone willing to tackle challenges, think critically, and work collaboratively. So, if you've ever hesitated to join one because of your major but still feel like business competitions could be your thing, take the leap.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/career/news/signs-you-are-being-exploited-your-internship-3886081","Signs that you are being exploited in your internship","Internships are short-term work opportunities where students or young professionals – mostly recent graduates – can gain hands-on experience in a particular field. Be it paid or unpaid, on-site or remote, the primary objectives of internships remain the same – to develop skills, gain industry exposure, and open doors to future opportunities. Interns expect to have access to opportunities, skill development, mentorship, networking, and even chances to explore different career paths. At the same time, employers seek fresh ideas, task support, and a chance to train potential hires when hiring interns. Basically, an internship serves as a valuable opportunity for both interns and employers. However, while internships may appear mutually beneficial, they can often be exploitative where interns are overworked, underpaid, or deprived of meaningful learning experiences. Thus, for interns or those seeking internship opportunities, being aware of whether or not they are being exploited has become vital in this day and age. The signs of such form of exploitation at the workplace are always there; you just have to look out for them. You are doing a full-time job on an intern's salary or, worse, for free Even though your job description clearly mentioned the working hours and the number of days you'd get off, now that you have finally signed up for the job, the reality can be far different from what was mentioned earlier. You often find yourself working overtime. You might be in a situation where nobody tells you when to stop. Even if the task can be done the next day, you are told that the task must be done immediately. If this is a daily scene at your internship, chances are you are being taken advantage of. No one is teaching you anything Internships are meant to be learning experiences. There should be arrangements for you to learn new things, and they should be provided to you by your employer in the form of mentorship, training sessions, or at least meaningful guidance. However, if you are constantly told to just get things done and have to figure most work or on-job related things out on your own, this is sort of exploitative. Even if they say that you have to learn while doing your daily tasks or you have to learn everything on your own, it comes off as exploitative. Self-learning is important but it should be structured with guidance, not substituted entirely with work. Your pay keeps getting delayed If your internship is paid, timely compensation should be non-negotiable. You might see that full-time employees are getting paid on time but your pay keeps getting delayed for one reason or another with varying excuses. If this keeps repeating, it's a strong indication that your employer does not respect your time or contribution. Paid working opportunities – be it full-time or an internship – means getting paid on time, and repeated failure in this regard is not a good sign. You are given responsibilities beyond your expertise with no support Challenging tasks are great for growth. But if challenges mean you are given responsibilities beyond your expertise without any support, things can actually turn out bitter. You might do your best to meet expectations, but without guidance, you're likely to struggle. And when the work doesn't turn out as expected, the blame falls on you rather than the lack of direction. Your employer makes you feel replaceable You are giving your best shot while overcoming all the odds, yet your employer can still make you feel replaceable. Instead of appreciating your work, they keep complaining about it, give vague or demotivating feedback, and make you feel like you're always on thin ice. This isn't constructive criticism; it's a tactic to keep you insecure and compliant. And don't fall for the idea that this so-called 'criticism' is to get the best out of you. It's not. This is just your employer or supervisor making you feel bad about yourself so that they can take the opportunity to exploit you even more. If one or more of these signs are visible right now or in the future, it might be time to rethink your internship. While internships can be valuable, they can also become exploitative if boundaries are not set. If you feel undervalued, overworked, or ignored, it's important to stand up for yourself.","Sat May 3, 2025 11:41 PM         Last update on: Sat May 3, 2025 11:46 PM"

This first-of-a-kind collaboration between academia and industry is aimed at redefining engineering education in Bangladesh. The collaboration is set to embed innovation, ethics, and societal responsibility at its very core, preparing a new generation of engineers to build a future that is inclusive, sustainable, and humane. Such academia-industry partnerships are very common in the West as well as in other parts of the world. These practices have helped institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Stanford receive funding and resources to achieve various academic and research goals. In Bangladesh, such collaboration is rarely seen, that too on this scale. This collaboration aligns with the BSRM's different social responsibility initiatives and BRAC University Founder Sir Fazle Hasan Abed's belief that education must be inclusive, impactful, and deeply connected to human dignity. The school is already running critical academic initiatives such as funding advanced research, establishing laboratories, and providing inspirational scholarships for meritorious and financially insolvent students. At Wednesday's event, Professor Arshad M Chowdhury, dean, School of Engineering, gave the welcome speech. In his speech, Alihussain Akberali, chairman, BSRM, said businesses, regardless of size, can play a vital role in shaping society and should actively collaborate with the government and other sectors in driving national development. ""Stay here, work here, and build here. Your knowledge, your energy, and your ideas are needed here. If you build a legacy now, it will serve generations to come,"" he told students. ""We hope that in this partnership between BRAC University and BSRM, you will see a powerful example of what becomes possible when two strong, value-driven organisations come together,"" added Akberali. ""We believe that this school and partnership will serve as a platform for nurturing the next generation of engineers – young minds who will be equipped not only with technical knowledge, but with strong moral values, a sense of responsibility, and a passion to serve the nation."" Tamara Hasan Abed, chairperson of the Board of Trustees, BRAC University, added, ""Today, as we inaugurate the BSRM School of Engineering, we reaffirm that education must be a force for dignity, justice, and opportunity."" ""We commit to fostering an environment where curiosity is celebrated, where diversity is cherished, and where every student believes they can be a driver of positive change,"" she said. Professor Syed Ferhat Anwar, vice-chancellor, BRAC University, said, ""I believe that this partnership will ensure that knowledge of the industry is put together in a meaningful way by the academia and shared with the entire world."" ""This partnership is an example for Bangladesh and, hopefully, for the global South,"" he added. ""This is what the BRAC and BRAC University synergy is about, and it reflects how BSRM not only does business but also focuses on safety for humanity."" Following the speeches by the guests, an experience-sharing session was held where alumni, faculty members, and students talked about their experiences at the School of Engineering.","Sat May 3, 2025 12:12 AM         Last update on: Sat May 3, 2025 03:40 AM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/severance-immensely-ambitious-fault-3885191","Severance is immensely ambitious to a fault","The premise, and promise, of Severance is simple. Imagine a complete removal of your work self from the version of you that exists off-the-clock. While a blessing to some, the concept itself presents many questions delving into the societal, ethical, and individualistic effects this surgical alienation from labour can have on people. These conundrums are the fertile grounds in which Severance plants its seed, and the results make for one of the most ambitious shows yet to be finished — one that, despite its narrative flaws, delivers plenty of tantalising mysteries and subsequent answers that keep the audience on their toes and yelling at their screens (the last bit might be just me though). The most important aspects of Severance make themselves apparent from the get-go. The shiny, pristine, and completely unnatural set design creates an atmosphere of surgically-designed claustrophobia, one in which all actions seem to be under a close watch. The show follows Mark, after spending a good few minutes crying in his car, entering his unnaturally bright workspace. Descending the elevator, his eyes reel back, as if he's undergoing a seizure, and he returns, not as himself, but as his 'innie' — the work version of Mark, also known as Mark S. Upon entering, he is informed of the abrupt dismissal of his best friend, Petey. No questions about the whys or hows are entertained from Mark, and he is promptly made to return to work. The work, by the way, consists of dragging numbers into folders. A nonsensical job described as mysterious and important. The story that unfolds from here works on multiple levels. Partly as a workplace satire, the show offers a unique perspective on corporations' involvement in alienating people from their work. The show masterfully delves into these 'innies' who are confined to exist only as workers, exploring their individual identities even within the walls of their workplace and their desire for more that ultimately brings them together. The end product is mystery, thrill, and many, many theories that demand roundtable discussions with friends. The finale for season one, in particular, was one of the most riveting hours of television I have seen in recent memory. Season two of Severance opens with an elevator ding and Mark S. hitting the ground running. He takes off, reeling from the events of season one, running past the sterile hallways for what feels like an eternity. To what end is Mark running, and what does he end up finding? Severance, as a story, builds itself around questions like these. Answers are doled out in small, but adequate portions, and the audience keeps asking for more. This is also perhaps one big spot where Severance falters. From a technical perspective, the direction ranges from great to near perfection (with season two's episode seven being a highlight). The acting does not falter for a second. The storytelling, too, is ambitious, almost too ambitious at times, as it is clear in parts of season two that the show certainly has an endgame, but it struggles to fill the gaps on how to get there. Certain episodes linger too long on plot beats that go nowhere, while other episodes include subplots filled with baffling character writing. While it manages to recuperate most of the damage by the end, season two tends to feel like a meandering journey. Created and written largely by Dan Erickson, who used to work at a door factory before this, Severance feels like an inspired piece of work that dives into corporate culture and the many ways people try to continue living in the decaying dystopia that corporations tend to create.","Fri May 2, 2025 04:37 PM         Last update on: Fri May 2, 2025 04:42 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/nostalgia-memory-and-the-power-physical-media-digital-world-3884896","Nostalgia, memory, and the power of physical media in a digital world","When cleaning my room, I often find myself stumbling across little pieces of my childhood. A dusty DVD, faded Eid card, old diaries filled with doodles and half-written thoughts, and a broken video game controller. Each one pulls me into a daydream. I get caught up going through them all, flipping through the pages of my diaries, reading old notes, and wondering where all the time went. Back then, I loved collecting these things. Now, however, it feels like they have been quietly collecting pieces of me all these years. I've been writing since I was a child, so naturally, my shelves and drawers became an archive of my past life, filled with friends, stories, and memories like nothing else. I didn't realise it at the time, but this personal collection became the driveway of my life. The place where I first understood that I wanted to be a writer. Every scrap of paper, every diary entry, and every little keepsake was a reflection of how much I loved telling stories. Looking back, it feels like those objects were not clutter but a foundation for the person I've grown into. In an increasingly digital world, the tactile experience of holding a cherished piece of physical media is an art form in and of itself. There's something uniquely grounding about having an object in your hands that carries and tells a story – a piece of the past that feels alive. Decades ago, physical media was not an option; it was the heart of how people engaged with art, music, and literature. Vinyl records were household staples during the 70s and 80s. Dropping the needle onto a record offered an experience – a moment of ritual that brought sound and soul together. As time moved on, cassettes and CDs took over, filling shelves and car dashboards, making music portable and personal. Letters and postcards, meanwhile, carried handwritten warmth, connecting hearts across distances in a way no text message ever could. Growing up, I often stumbled across pieces of this world tucked away in the corners of my family's archives. Old CDs of Tagore's songs. Books from my uncles' childhoods, their pages filled with pencil marks. Letters were my favorites – carefully folded and yellowed with age, but bursting with the warmth from a time I had only heard about in stories. These objects became bridges to a past I felt connected to, even if I hadn't lived it. Even films had a different magic back then. VHS tapes and DVDs became prized possessions, with carefully curated collections lining living rooms. Watching a movie was about choosing a beloved film from your collection, placing it in the player, and enjoying the experience with intention. To many, collections are personal archives. They are reflections of tastes and values, and, to this day, the beauty of those tangible experiences remains. But with the rise of digital media, much of this culture has shifted. The convenience of streaming services and e-books has made physical media feel obsolete to some. Yet, there's a growing realisation that something gets lost in the process. Digital files lack the warmth of a handwritten letter, the joy of finding a rare vinyl in a second-hand shop, or the nostalgia of flipping through an old photo album. Physical media brings a sense of grounding in a world that often feels too fast and intangible.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/mindless-littering-and-our-inability-keep-our-streets-clean-3884686","Mindless littering and our inability to keep our streets clean","Stuck in traffic, my uncle—a brilliant doctor, whose mind expands well beyond my reach—recently returned from a medical course in Singapore and leaned back in his seat, speaking about the city-state's stringent laws. Singapore, he said, functioned like a well-oiled machine. No one littered there; the mere thought of tossing a wrapper on the ground came with the consequence of a thousand-dollar fine. He spoke with the kind of reverence usually reserved for holy sites. And then, mid-sentence, without so much as a pause, he rolled down the window and flung something out onto the Dhaka streets. I blinked. Had I imagined it? The irony hung between us. Perhaps it was habit, muscle memory, or the subconscious override of years spent knowing there was no price to pay for carelessness. Such is the case with the people of Bangladesh. One afternoon on my university bus, I watched a girl unwrap a snack, eat it, then—without hesitation, without even a flicker of awareness—crumple the empty packet and toss it out the window. The motion was instinctual, as if the streets of Dhaka were nothing more than an extension of the bin, she didn't feel the need to use. I couldn't help myself—I asked if she thought what she had just done was right. She looked startled, mumbled an apology, but I knew, with absolute certainty, that the city would see more litter from her hands. A good education, it turns out, does little to correct bad habits. The streets would absorb it all, as they always did, as if this was simply how things were meant to be. It's a subtle kind of disillusionment—watching children toss wrappers onto the street while their parents, unfazed, look straight ahead. There's no reprimand, no moment of correction, because, of course, the parents do the same. I try to be a nuisance about it, a small disruption in the rhythm of their indifference, but I rarely succeed. Teaching someone the collective responsibility of keeping a city clean feels like trying to empty the Buriganga with a teacup. The response is always the same, a phrase that makes me angry—Everyone else does it. As if filth were a democracy, as if participation were mandatory. If everyone is complicit in turning the streets into a wasteland, why rush to add to the ruin? My bag, overstuffed with receipts, wrappers, and the occasional stray bottle cap, resents me for making it double as a dustbin. But I carry my trash like a quiet rebellion, a small defiance against the tide of indifference. At least the streets have no reason to curse my name. ""The people of this country will never change,"" someone declares, punctuating the thought with a spit onto the pavement. The irony is almost too perfect. It's astonishing—the ease with which people refuse to alter the smallest of habits while demanding transformation on a grand scale. Some, in a feat of mental gymnastics, even absolve themselves entirely saying, at least this gives the cleaners something to do. As if the dignity of labour must include scraping their discarded wrappers off the asphalt. As if cleaners have nothing more pressing to tend to than the trail of thoughtlessness left in their wake. ""Everyone else is doing it""—the easiest excuse for avoiding responsibility. It suggests that if enough people do something wrong, it somehow stops being wrong. But litter doesn't disappear just because many hands have thrown it; it piles up, choking drains, cluttering streets, and making the city harder to live in. If anything, seeing others litter should make us more determined not to. The excuse also shifts blame onto an invisible crowd, as if the problem exists in the abstract, never in the individual act of tossing a wrapper onto the pavement. Change has to start somewhere, and refusing to contribute to the mess is as good a place as any. Before praising the spotless streets of some distant, developed nation, perhaps the better question would be to ask: What am I doing to keep my own streets clean? It's easy to admire discipline from afar, to romanticise the strict fines and civic responsibility of another country, but the real work begins with the smallest, most inconvenient choices. Even if your bag groans under the weight of stray wrappers and receipts, even if you become that insufferable person who points out every careless toss, it's worth it. My family rolls their eyes at me, sighs when I refuse to let things slide, but they litter less. And in a city where change feels impossible, even the smallest shift feels like a big win.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/shrouded-shame-and-eventually-forgotten-sexual-harassment-policies-across-universities-bangladesh-3884116","Shrouded by shame and eventually forgotten: Sexual harassment policies across universities in Bangladesh ","Last year, Campus published a few articles on campus safety, gender-based violence, and sexual harassment on campus. This prompted us to study 20 cases of gender-based violence (GBV) on public university campuses between May 2023 and October 2024, uncovering deep-rooted systemic issues. The incidents, which included sexual harassment, assault, and discriminatory policies, predominantly impacted women and gender-diverse individuals. While some perpetrators were held accountable, institutional responses remained inconsistent and were often shaped by power dynamics. Many survivors chose not to report their experiences, deterred by stigma and a lack of trust in the system. The scenario is not all that different in private universities. We spoke to a victim in the middle of last year, back when hope still poured out of her voice. She believed in the system then – felt that enough people cared, that the university's administration would do right by her. There was conviction in her words, a confidence that justice was within reach. When we reached out again a few days ago, she was barely recognisable. The confidence she had just a year prior eroded, replaced by something brittle – something broken. Not just disappointment, but exhaustion. She is a student at Dhaka University and wishes to remain anonymous. ""After the uprising, I keep hearing about reform,"" she tells us. ""When I approached the authorities, they said changes are underway, and that's why no decision has been made yet.""  But she isn't convinced. To her, the delays are not about policy changes or bureaucratic red tape. They are about something more familiar: a sheer lack of importance and neglect. A way of waiting just long enough for the issue to fade, for the voices to quiet, and for justice to be forgotten. Another student from a renowned private university in Bangladesh echoed the sentiments of her fellow student from Dhaka University. In her case, it was a faculty member who conducted themselves inappropriately. ""He had been my advisor back in the first semester. When I went to the campus for the first time to get my advising done, he put me in his class. Later on, during the semester, I had missed a class. When I went back to the next class, he asked me whether or not I wanted to visit his office during consultation hours so that he could help cover whatever I had missed. When I got there, however, he spent very little time teaching me anything and eventually began asking me personal questions and making inappropriate remarks,"" she recalls. Although she wanted to report what had happened to her, she did not do so because she felt like nothing would be done even if she took measures. ""This isn't the first time something like this has happened. He has also made someone else I know very uncomfortable by saying crude things,"" she says. ""I am certain he has done similar things to multiple students. Even if at least one of them reported their experience in the past, it's clear that adequate measures were not taken. So, it occurred to me that it wouldn't make a difference even if I reported my experience."" Speaking to Dr Saifuddin Ahmed, Proctor of Dhaka University, revealed several administrative shortcomings in ensuring campus safety. He says, ""While policies addressing sexual harassment do exist, there are no regular training sessions to raise awareness among students or staff. Although there are broad guidelines, the university lacks a clear and enforceable service rule for its employees."" Dr Ahmed stressed the importance of making students aware of these policies and reporting systems if they are subjected to sexual harassment. He noted that efforts are underway to improve this. He also highlighted various legal and procedural challenges. These include difficulties in collecting practical evidence, procedural delays, fear of social stigma, and concerns about academic harassment. Dr Ahmed underscored the importance of establishing a system that ensures the confidentiality of victims throughout the entire reporting and investigation process. He also mentioned plans to work with legal experts to develop checklists that would not derail the progress of cases, even if there is a change in university administration. Dr Ahmed further pointed out flaws in the process of appointing faculty members. He says, ""Strong academic results alone should not determine a candidate's suitability for a teaching position. Instead, it is equally important to assess whether the individual demonstrates integrity and ethical conduct."" Following the interview with the proctor, one could not help but sense a troubling absence of urgency – or perhaps will – in addressing sexual harassment on campus. Policies, it appears, do exist in theory, and if earnestly applied, they might as well serve as deterrents. Yet it is precisely the ""if"" that lingers: the mechanisms of implementation remain elusive.   Musharrat Sharmee Hossain, a senior lecturer at the Department of English and Modern Languages in North South University (NSU) and a former assistant proctor who was also involved in formulating NSU's code of conduct explains, ""There are multiple ways for students to reach out and report their experiences. Even then, incidents of sexual violence are not reported, which one could claim is a national problem. Victims tend to be reluctant to disclose their experiences, in which case a teacher (with whom they feel comfortable) might encourage or help them to do so.""  ""As there is an inclination to attach shame to the victims' experiences, people still harbour the belief that talking about whatever happened to them will pose issues in the future or even invite trouble from their parents,"" she adds. While Musharrat Sharmee reinforced NSU's commitment to ensuring the safety of its students, she did mention that the code of conduct needs to be updated or revised, especially in terms of clauses pertaining to students' online safety. She also mentioned that she did not receive any mandatory training on preventing harassment. In an interview with Ekhon Television, Dr Upama Kabir, head of Dhaka University's Anti-Sexual Harassment Cell, says, ""As the previous committee neither resolved past cases nor provided any conclusions or decisions, these cases remain pending. Once they are reassigned to us, we will conduct a re-verification and proceed with the necessary next steps."" It was a High Court directive issued 16 years ago that instructed universities to set up sexual harassment prevention committees. While it was an initiative worthy of praise, time has revealed that the order fell short in really tackling the issue. And that is because policymakers have failed to properly perceive and diagnose the roots of the problem: a culture that not only breeds dominance but relies on it to control and thwart the autonomy of women and gender-diverse individuals. As a result, it views incidents of harassment as isolated occurrences and not a result of the culture of dominance. Nonetheless, if individuals from these very demographics are not involved in formulating policies and their concerns are continued to be shunned out, then this vicious cycle will continue.  That is not to say that institutional policies are not needed. They are required to tackle the pressing issue that has been borne out of the gross negligence displayed towards the safety of women and gender-diverse individuals. Moreover, the most fundamental function of these institutions is to educate and enlighten young minds. They wield significant influence not only on the discourse surrounding issues of sexual violence but also in terms of informing people, raising awareness, and to various extents breaking the stigma that prevails. The culture of domination is pervasive. And as institutions that continue to function with it in the backdrop, they bear some responsibility in dismantling it.","Thu May 1, 2025 10:00 AM         Last update on: Thu May 1, 2025 10:00 AM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/challenges-female-drivers-face-bangladesh-3883551","Challenges female drivers face in Bangladesh","Picture this: a woman steers her way through gridlocked Dhaka traffic as ripples of turning heads follow in her wake. Curious glances, some fleeting and others lingering, turn instinctively — a few drawn from admiration, others laced with scepticism. The hum of engines and the cacophony of honking horns momentarily seem to pause as passing drivers, pedestrians, and rickshaw pullers steal a glance, as though the sight of a woman in control of the wheel is something otherworldly, something to behold. This is a stark reality that countless women in Bangladesh encounter every day. Despite an increasing number of female drivers gaining visibility over time, the streets still prevalently reflect a scene of male dominance. For many women, driving is not just about navigating the roads, but the need to overcome pervasive societal biases while grappling with safety concerns. Bushra Tabassum, a senior HR executive at an IT firm, has been behind the wheel for the past seven years. She acknowledges the common assumption that female drivers are incompetent, which initially unsettled her. ""People are adamant that women are bad drivers,"" she says. ""But I've learned to disregard it. Even my own friends doubted my abilities before witnessing my driving firsthand."" Bushra recounts facing a constant barrage of unfair accusations on the road. ""Accidents often result in immediate blame being directed towards me, regardless of culpability,"" she says. ""But I always speak up and confront any attempt to shift responsibility, be it from a male driver or a rickshaw puller."" However, for many, such has not been the case. Despite holding a driver's license since 2016, Rebeka Tanji Tania, Assistant Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at BGMEA University of Fashion & Technology (BUFT), still struggles to muster the confidence to drive on her own. ""Navigating the roads alongside male drivers requires being loud, assertive, and ready to defend oneself against unwarranted blame. In our country, traffic regulations are loosely implemented, and everyone drives however they please. Male drivers can easily assert control on the streets by shouting or swearing to tackle directed accusations because people are so used to it. But for me, that isn't quite the option,"" she speculates on her hesitancy. Female drivers often become a spectacle, being at the receiving end of unwanted attention, commentary, and even intimidation. While the scenario is relatively better in certain affluent regions inside Dhaka, challenges are far more harrowing in other parts of the country. ""While driving inside Cumilla district, I noticed that autorickshaw drivers would pause in the middle of the road, eventually leading to clogged traffic. They would blatantly stare at me in disbelief, that a woman is capable of steering the wheel, and even female passengers shared the same incredulous gaze. I have had similar experiences while driving in Mohammadpur as well,"" Mahamuda Peya, a former employee of bKash and British American Tobacco, shares. In Bangladesh, the lack of road safety awareness poses risks to all drivers, but for women, the challenges are amplified. Women are generally considered safer drivers than men, based on the ratio of road accidents accounted for by either group. However, the constant scrutiny that they encounter from outsiders plays as an external factor in interrupting their concentration while driving. Sarmily Sarker, Professor of Fashion Design at BUFT, has been driving in Bangladesh and abroad for almost a decade. Her endeavour began with riding a bicycle, then switching to a scooter during her student years, before she eventually bought a car. Reflecting on the erratic nature of Dhaka's streets, she states, ""People are remarkably unbothered about road safety. For instance, when I'm driving at high speed, pedestrians often raise a hand at the last moment and step onto the road, expecting traffic to pause instantaneously. It is incredibly difficult to halt on such short notice, and if an accident occurs, the blame inevitably falls on the driver. But people don't seem to realise the nuances."" In addition to all these setbacks, female drivers are constantly required to be on guard for their safety. For instance, the absence of proper parking spaces often creates significant security concerns for female drivers. Many hesitate to park in isolated areas, fearing harassment or worse. A great number of female drivers also refrain from using ride-sharing services like Uber as a source of possible income. ""Some areas are unsafe to go to alone, and people always try to create more problems for female drivers,"" Bushra laments. She recalls a distressing experience: ""One day, I was driving amidst heavy rainfall, and a car in front of me suddenly hit brakes. A man stepped out of the vehicle and tried to get inside my car. Since I was alone, I didn't take any risks. He lingered outside for a while, but I quickly drove away."" Similarly, Peya also recounts having to endure several unfortunate occurrences where she was subjected to verbal persecution by the mass public. Remembering one such incident, she says, ""While reversing out of a parking space, my car once crashed into another. Within minutes, a crowd gathered, and a group of bikers began insisting that the female driver's license be checked."" She continues, ""As the damage was significant on both ends, the police soon intervened. I refused to resolve because I was not at fault and demanded compensation. What shocked me most was that the officer reviewed the man's driving license immediately upon arrival, yet before that, the mob had only pressured me to show mine. I stood my ground and made it clear that they had no authority to demand my license. If I had to show mine, then so should the other person."" The rise in mob violence and frequent attacks on women heightens fears for female drivers. While speaking to our respondents, we found some of them expressing grave concern over the worsening state of public security in the country. Following recent events, many women consider themselves prone to rising threats of violence, further marginalising them. On top of that, frequent incidents of mugging and robbery flag them as easy targets and further fuel their unease about driving alone. Such concerns are not unfounded. Women on the road continue to face an uphill battle, from deep-seated negative mindsets to pressing security threats. While their presence behind the wheel is gradually increasing, the truth is that female drivers regularly continue to face a myriad of issues. Their experiences vastly differ from that of their male counterparts, and almost never in a positive way. Therefore, without improvised law and order and discernible changes in societal attitude, female drivers are constrained to battle against the challenges that continue to encumber them.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/recognising-high-achievers-the-24th-o-level-awards-3881321","Recognising high achievers at the 24th O & A Level Awards","On April 26, 2025, The Daily Star hosted the 24th edition of its prestigious O & A Level Awards at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center in Dhaka Bypass Expressway, Sector 4, Purbachal. For English medium students of Bangladesh, this award is the most prestigious recognition for their outstanding achievements in O and A level examinations. The 24th O & A Level Awards had HSBC Bank Bangladesh as the title sponsor. Pearson Edexcel and IDP were the academic and education partners of the event respectively. Dr Asif Nazrul, Adviser, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, and Syeda Rizwana Hasan, Adviser, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Ministry of Water Resources, were present at the event as the Chief Guests. The award ceremony also featured inspirational talks by Shahir Chowdhury, Founder and CEO of Shikho; Rahat Ahmed, Founding Partner and CEO of Anchorless Bangladesh; and Ayman Sadiq, Founder and CEO of 10 Minute School. Speeches were also given by Tanmi Haque, Head of International Wealth and Premier Banking of HSBC Bangladesh; Razib Mahbubul, Country Director, IDP Education Bangladesh Ltd.; and Abdullah Al Mamun Liton, Regional Development Manager for Pearson Edexcel, Bangladesh & Nepal. The event started at 9:50 AM with a one-minute silence remembering the victims of the 2024 July Uprising, followed by the national anthem. In his speech, Mahfuz Anam, Editor and Publisher of The Daily Star, said, ""If you are going to be the nation-builders of tomorrow, you must first love your nation. You have to love your country, your people, your culture, your religion, and all of what you stand for. If you don't, you cannot be the nation-builders of tomorrow."" ""There is no substitute for hard work,"" Anam added. ""Many of you will go to the best universities in the world. But throughout your global experience, increase your commitment to come back and serve this country so that we may all feel proud of your achievement. Your achievement must be translated to the nation's achievement.""  The Editor also praised the parents of the awardees and expressed his gratitude for the role they played in bringing their children so far. Later, in a conversation with Campus, Mini Musharrat Sayeed, the Principal of Juvenile English Medium School, said, ""Our students can achieve a lot of things in life but first, they have to be what they want to be."" ""You should take your education very seriously. Then, you can achieve whatever it is you want to achieve, and this will motivate you to do better things in the future,"" she explained. For students attending the programme, it was a joyous occasion. Rayna Sadat, an awardee and O level graduate from Bangladesh International School and College, expressed her jubilation saying, ""It felt really great to be at the programme and receive the award. In the past, I have seen my school seniors and family members getting the award. It is now finally my turn to receive the same award."" The Daily Star has been holding the O & A Level Awards every year since 1999. It has been a very prestigious programme that all English Medium students look forward to. This year, the programme recognised the extraordinary achievements of 2,375 students from 112 schools around the country. Among them, there were 1,824 O level awardees – including 67 World Highest achievers and 62 Country Highest achievers – and 551 A level awardees – including 15 World Highest achievers and 32 Country Highest achievers.","Sun Apr 27, 2025 04:13 PM         Last update on: Sun Apr 27, 2025 04:38 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/lost-real-life-charlies-chocolate-factory-3880611","Lost in a real-life Charlie’s chocolate factory","A few thousand miles away from Dhaka, in a small town located in the outskirts of Zurich lies a place known for its signature centerpiece worldwide, a fountain of real chocolate. Emphasis on real chocolate! It's the Lindt Chocolate Fountain, a giant, golden whisk standing at 9.3 meters that drips 1,500 kg of chocolate creating an illusion of endless creamy goodness that welcomes all your senses as soon as you step inside the enormous chocolate factory, the Lindt Home of Chocolate. The entry doors work albeit in an amusingly different way. Unlike the preconceived notion of scan and enter, these doors only let you in at the time slot you selected during the online purchase. But of course, you are free to try a dozen times! Because I surely did. On the bright side, this means a bit more time to take pictures with the gorgeous fountain, if you're early. Or grab a sweet treat at the Lindt Café right next to the entrance doors. The most suitable ticket for adults and tourists is priced at 17 CHF or about 2,345 BDT and it is recommended to buy in advance. The chocolate tour begins with a vast but digestible history of chocolate. Don't forget to grab the audio guide (available in several languages) which makes the learning process interactive and much easier, especially for those who do not want to read blocks of text. Personally, I found the introductory section of the museum very interesting and intellectually enriching. It simply makes you look at cocoa beans and chocolate differently. But, like the rest of my family, many prefer to fast forward to the chocolate tasting part! This part of the building is the busiest, no doubt. Everybody wants to have a bite! It's like reconnecting with your younger self and finally fulfilling the dream of binging infinite chocolate. The first point serves hot chocolate from the three core varieties: dark, white, and milk. With a spoonful of white chocolate, I headed to the next section: chocolate bars! Now, here are huge dispensers with glass walls set up in a fixed carousel that pop a bar when your hand motions forward. Quick and easy. There are over ten different kinds of flavor. And you must try them all. Jogging my memory, some of my favorites were sea salt, hazelnut, and orange. Mint, chili, and coconut were some of the one-of-a kind flavors that stuck with me. At the end of the tour, you will find the world's largest Lindt store. For any chocolate lover, it's quite a bewildering experience. Whether it is a bar, or a ball, or something entirely different, I have spotted plenty of Lindt flavors that are not found anywhere else. My only regret is that I did not hoard enough flavors to try, a psychological side-effect of gorging mouthfuls of pralines. And as I left with a bag full of chocolatey souvenirs and little gifts from Lindt, I only wished to share this moment with the ones waiting for me at home.","Sat Apr 26, 2025 06:00 PM         Last update on: Sat Apr 26, 2025 06:10 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/when-they-look-away-3878316","When they look away","It took two and a half hours to get to the stadium. From the car, one could see the lines stretching two to three kilometres all the way from the entrance. The girls in the backseat were worried about how they'd have to wait at least another half an hour to get in – and that too in the April heat. The one driving the car, Asgar, was worried about finding parking after dropping them off. Asgar didn't have time for lunch today. He had arrived a bit late for duty that afternoon, and he could see how enraged Iva was from the frown above her eyes, the puff in her cheeks, and her flaring nostrils. Asgar's employers are usually pretty well-mannered and courteous when it comes to hiding their rage and disgust in front of others – but Asgar doesn't really count as 'others'. They don't pay him fifteen thousand a month, lunch included, just to have to show decency to their driver. ""It's okay, ma'am,"" Asgar lied, hoping Iva wouldn't start shouting at him. ""I had my lunch at home, so we can start right now!"" When Asgar dropped Iva and her friends off at the concert, she handed him a 100-taka note and told him to get some dinner, in case the concert ran late. Asgar took the money and nodded gratefully, hoping Iva would forget about him arriving late today and not complain to her father. Asgar drove around the stadium complex, trying to find parking under some shade. Then he could sit in the car with the windows open and get some sleep. Without shade, the heat was too much to bear, and opening the windows only brought in hot, dusty air. During the heatwave last May, Iva's mother got furious when she caught Asgar inside the car all by himself with the air conditioner on. He'd been extra careful in finding the right parking spot since then – preferably under a tree, but not too far from the exit, since Iva hated waiting for the car to come pick her up. Asgar finally found one, under an extended balcony on the second floor of the stadium building. He could see a bunch of drivers a few feet away. ""Bhai, do you know a restora somewhere around?"" Asgar asked. The five of them laughed together.  ""That's what we were just talking about! There isn't a single one in the entire area. Jobbar here had the audacity to go ask one of the stalls what a single egg sandwich cost. Tell him, Jobbar!"" one of them laughed, slapping Jobbar on the back. Jobbar looked gravely embarrassed by his foolishness. ""Three hundred fifty taka,"" he said quietly. The others broke into wheezing laughter, clapping as they did. ""How much did your one give you?"" one of them asked Asgar. Asgar searched his pocket and showed them the hundred-taka note. ""Not bad. Rokib here got fifty."" ""What can you even get for fifty? Chih!"" one of them consoled Rokib. ""I know their habits very well,"" said Rokib. ""That's why I had two plates of rice during lunch – way more than I had appetite for. This will have to do till tomorrow morning."" Tomorrow morning felt like days away in this heat. But at least it would be a new day –and one day less than sixty-two. That's how far he was from his next vacation. He gets two a year, on the two Eids. That's when he gets to see his wife and son. No child should have to see his father only twice a year, but asking for extra time off two years ago had earned him a final warning from Iva's mother, before she threatened to fire him. So, he saved up his emergency leave and used it when his mother passed away. When the headliners took the stage, Asgar and the others could hear screams from inside the stadium. Rokib recognised some of the songs, but it was too hot out in the parking lot for him to enjoy them. ""8:03 PM,"" said Jobbar. ""It'll go on till at least eleven. Then another hour to get out of the area and cross the traffic."" ""Do you think they think about us?"" Asgar muttered. The deafening noise from inside the stadium slowly dulled. Asgar knew all five of them had heard the question – because they'd all asked it themselves at some point. The people inside the stadium, the ones in the restaurants, in the theatres, at the shopping malls, at the weddings – do they ever ask themselves: Where do they really go during those long hours? ""Is this your first time waiting this long?"" Jobbar asked. ""I think so,"" replied Asgar. ""It'll come soon,"" said Jobbar. ""It's hot enough out here."" ""What do you mean?"" Asgar asked, as Jobbar raised a hand and shushed him. As they sat quietly, Asgar saw the soil beneath them getting wet with drops of water. He looked up, searching for rain but the sky didn't have a hint of cloud. When he looked at the others, he saw them all staring down at the ground as drops of sweat fell and formed a stream. In no time, it pooled into a transparent sheet of water. Asgar could see his reflection in the pool. His face, his shirt drenched in sweat – it all looked the same. But in the reflection, the sky above their heads was pitch-dark, like the minutes before Kalboishakhi. From the other end, he could smell petrichor. As he knelt down to breathe in the scent and the cool air, he slipped and fell face-first into the pool. Jobbar laughed and helped him up. ""You see, Asgar,"" he said, ""the world needs someone to drive the brats around. But if the drivers, the rickshawalas, and the security guards keep dying from heat strokes –who'll open the car doors for them? This world, it finds a way to keep the rats alive, you see. And so, when the heat becomes too unbearable, and when the pigs aren't looking – the portal opens up."" The five of the lay down on the concrete floor, looking up at the thunders crackling between the clouds. In the distance, Asgar could see some other drivers lying on the grass. The band inside the stadium had started their final song. The drums, the cheers from the crowd – none of it reached Asgar as he closed his eyes and listened to the hush before the storm.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/girls-stepping-the-world-robotics-3878301","Girls stepping into the world of robotics","Robotics is an exciting and rapidly growing field where creativity meets logic and innovation becomes reality. While it has traditionally been seen as a male-dominated field – often discouraging girls through stereotypes, lack of representation, and limited financial and emotional support – this is quickly changing. Bangladesh, often overlooked in global tech discussions, has quietly cultivated a thriving robotics culture, particularly for young women. In fact, the national team that earned two gold, four silver, and four bronze medals in the 26th International Robot Olympiad (IRO) held in Busan, South Korea, marked a significant milestone for girls in robotics. Six out of ten members of that amazing team were women. For any girl who's curious about robotics but unsure how to start, there's never been a better time to dive in. As robots are basically computers and do not understand human language, at least not directly, our only way of communicating with or commanding these robots is through programming languages. Hence, it is essential that you get comfortable with coding first before getting into the hardware side of robotics. Your entry into coding doesn't necessarily have to be through robotics. Nasheetat Zainah Rahman, a three-time gold medallist at the IRO, entered the world of coding through basic game development. ""Since I loved gaming so much, my mom introduced me to Scratch – a block-based programming platform, says Nasheetat. ""The ability to create my own games felt almost magical. It was my first step into the world of programming."" ""At the same time, I had a deep love for LEGO, and when I discovered the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit, I was instantly captivated by the idea of building and programming my own robot. That was the moment when my robotics journey began,"" Nasheetat adds. Nasheetat recommends learning Python if you plan to work with Raspberry Pi kits and C++ if you plan to use Arduino. While both Raspberry Pi and Arduino are used in robotics, the latter is preferred for beginners while the Raspberry Pi is a better option for advanced robotics projects.  Once you grasp the basics, consider working on simple projects like obstacle-avoiding or line-following robots. If your school doesn't have a dedicated robotics club for you to seek help, there are various Facebook and Reddit communities that you can turn to. A major advantage for beginners is that tutorials for basic robotics projects are readily available on YouTube, so you can easily find step-by-step guides on how to get started with these projects. Once you familiarise yourself with the basics, you can think of attending workshops organised by various schools, universities, and organisations to learn more. These workshops are usually open to all, and Nasheetat, in particular, benefited from them. ""Eager to learn more, I attended an Arduino workshop which introduced me to more advanced robotics concepts,"" says Nasheetat. ""It was also there that I first heard about the Bangladesh Robot Olympiad – a discovery that led to years of participating in competitions, countless hours of building and coding, and an ever-growing passion for robotics."" Attending robotic workshops also gives you an opportunity to seek professional feedback on your projects. Similar feedback can be obtained if you attend science fairs or participate in local robot olympiads. ""Attending workshops organised by the Bangladesh Robot Olympiad (BDRO), in particular, will be immensely helpful here,"" says Namia Rauzat Nubala, a ninth-grader IRO gold medallist from HURDCO International School. ""You can learn about robotics as well as prepare for the national rounds of the robotics olympiads."" Dedicated robotics workshops for girls are also organised frequently by these organisations. Similar initiatives are also taken by various independent communities and clubs to encourage more women to involve themselves in robotics. As for the components needed to build robots, you can find them in local hardware stores. Most students and robotics enthusiasts, however, opt for online shops like RoboticsBD and TechShopbd to get the necessary hardware. One major advantage of buying from these online stores is that they deliver all over the country. For advanced projects, if you need special kits or components, some of these stores have the option to pre-order them. Know that it's never too late to join robotics. Maisha Sobhan, a student at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Jahangirnagar University, and an IRO gold medallist, ventured into robotics only after finishing her SSC exams in 2022. ""I mainly relied on online resources to teach myself from scratch with slight aid from a tutor,"" she shares. In just a few months, she went from being a beginner to a national-level competitor. Beyond the technology itself, learning robotics builds essential skills like critical thinking, creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork. Practical experience in this field also makes you a more competitive candidate when applying to universities abroad. Many past Bangladeshi IRO participants went on to study at prestigious universities around the world with scholarships. Getting into the national team has its own perks. ""My favourite part of doing robotics was probably the fact that I got to stay in a foreign country for a week with my friends, says Maisha. ""The journey as a whole was very delightful and allowed me to learn and experience many new things."" All that being said, the path isn't always smooth for girls looking to get into robotics. Societal barriers remain, and girls are often discouraged from pursuing robotics, as the lack of local female role models makes it appear as a masculine field to many parents. This prejudice stems from our gendered upbringing that caters to the patriarchal roles assigned to us: boys are made to play with toy robots and build with LEGO, while girls are given Barbie dolls to play house with. A study by the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) found that only 11 percent of STEM toys were marketed to girls, reinforcing early ideas about who ""belongs"" in tech. This conditioning feeds into later under-representation. ""One thing that's still common, sadly, is the misconception that girls don't know how to work with hardware, so girls are thought to be less capable in robotics,"" says Maisha. Concerns around safety and gender-based harassment further limit participation in public tech spaces. Such barriers to entry mean parents are often less willing to invest the same time, effort, and money into helping their daughters get into this field as they might be for their sons, mostly due to scepticism about whether their daughters' tech ambitions will lead to tangible success. Thus, getting started with robotics as a girl doesn't just change your life; in a way, it changes the field itself. After all, it challenges stereotypes, diversifies innovation, and empowers the next generation of girls. You might not have had role models growing up, but you can be one for someone else. As a final word of advice, Maisha says, ""Believe in yourselves. I used to think I was just lucky, but I realised my hard work mattered. Believing in yourself gets you halfway there—the rest is consistency.""","Thu Apr 24, 2025 11:00 AM         Last update on: Thu Apr 24, 2025 11:00 AM"

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/the-life-altering-mundanity-adulthood-3877496","The life altering mundanity of adulthood","As children, we all wanted to fast-track our childhood and become adults. We assumed adults had infinite money, could stay out or up as late as they wanted to, or never had to ask for permission for anything. They had freedom, autonomy, and fun. We couldn't wait to be a part of it. However, now that I have entered my 20s, the rose-tinted glasses have come off. As we unfortunately step onto the throes of adulthood and grasp how taxing it truly is (pun intended), life is a series of concurring thoughts, constantly screaming: ""No, this is not what I asked for! Give me a refund."" As an adult, you're constantly exhausted. You have no idea where your money goes. You're not sure if you even want to know. After a certain point, your whole body hurts, all the time. You discover the value of a proper sleep schedule. You have to fight against all odds to have an emblem of a social life while also ensuring your social battery does not get depleted. And the list goes on. Thus, as an ode to the chaotic ordeal which is adulthood, below are some moments that have shocked or will shock all new adults at some point with the realisation: 'Oh, I'm an adult now'. Watching your dear friends, with whom you hold the fondest memories of being dumb, embarrassing, and chaotic together, getting married is a surreal experience. These are people we used to play with, shared our tiffins with, and always found just a call away. We were kids together. And now they're starting a family, following different threads in life. Of course, it is a joy to witness. But the reality of it, of how far we have come, and how farther life is yet to take us, is always hard to accept. We were never really taught how to navigate the intricate web of taxation. While we all clearly remember that 'the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell', we are rarely given a clue about what entails the process of filing taxes in school. As we grow up, we gradually get a glimpse of what taxes are, only to learn it is something the rich avoid to preserve their wealth while the rest are left to scramble. Hence, finally getting a proper look at the bureaucratic nightmare of taxes – with its vague eligibility criteria and rules, endless forms and errands – can be disconcerting. The concept of home as a kid was unmarred - cosy and free of obligations. As you grow older and finally reach the age where you have to pay rent, you realise just how expensive it is to have a place just to rest and belong; that home actually has a price tag. Sure, it also instills a more solid sense of belonging and assurance, but the amount it takes away from your income each month also leaves you in a cold sweat which refuses to fully dry up. As kids, core memories in grocery shops consisted of us whining to our mothers to get us a snack, only to get a reluctant ""Fine"" as a response. But as adults, a trip down the grocery aisle is organised and stressful. You almost always opt for the necessities, only going for a few occasional treats, but even then, the resulting bill results in hair loss. To make matters worse, realising that each grocery haul lasts only a handful of days just feels like a never-ending cruel joke. The biggest thing about reaching adulthood is realising there's no space to make excuses anymore, no space to stumble and learn. Adulthood does not offer the safety net that childhood did. Gone are the days of trial and error. You are always expected to keep it together. To have a plan, to be responsible. You cannot act on a whim. You are always expected to keep your cool, especially with your parents because they are old now and so are you, somehow. You cannot do a single thing, such as missing out on sleep or eating too much junk food, without experiencing the consequences. The world demands you know better, and you are expected to deliver.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/de-extinct-dire-wolves-and-the-importance-science-communication-3876816","Of de-extinct ‘dire wolves’ and the importance of science communication ","On March 5, 2025, the current president of the United States made a claim about 'wasteful government funding' being spent on making mice transgender: a baffling claim to anyone with the patience and reservation to think about it. As proof, the White House's official website released information about transgenic mice, i.e. mice that have been artificially infused with genes from a different organism — undergoing hormone therapy as part of experiments for the treatment of Asthma, HIV, and even physical wounds. Of the claims made regarding transgender mice, no evidence was to be seen anywhere. The conclusion, while crystal clear, leaves room for questions in my mind: Why is it that such an argument became a hot topic for people around the globe? Why was the lack of knowledge regarding science allowed to be weaponised for bigotry? The inaccessibility of science has always been one of its biggest detractors. Today, whatever bleeding-edge technology exists typically functions to deliver answers regarding some high-concept theory. Science is moving further and further away from the realm of easy accessibility and, to make matters worse, scientists in their ivory towers rarely offer help. The language of science is one that is heavy with jargon, and rarely communicates well to anyone not well-versed in that field to begin with. Knowledge, thus, remains trapped in a bubble. But what makes matters worse is that this leaves knowledge open to be co-opted and warped to sell to the media and, by extension, the masses. Take another example, one slightly more recent. The 'de-extinct' direwolves made headlines across the spectrum of news media. Everyone was too caught up in celebrating this incredible feat of science (or how adorable those pups look) to actually look into the science of how this was achieved. The pitch that was sold to these news outlets was that these were the same species of dire wolves that went extinct many years ago. However, the truth of these dire wolves being genetically modified variations of grey wolves was, while not hidden, kept at a distance from the limelight. It was only after the initial wave of excitement died out that people took to reading through the available data in order to come to a different conclusion: the science, while groundbreaking, was sold in a rather misleading way.  The unifying factor for both the dire wolf and the transgender mice situations lies solely in how science, scientific development and study, and the accrued knowledge acquired through careful and laborious research have become a hotbed for misleading mass media coverage. Marketers, advertisers, and politicians are experts in the art of 'communication' — the fact that the thing they're communicating may be misleading is of no consequence to them. This is precisely why communicating science — the intricacies of it — by those well-versed in the science is crucial. Now more than ever, the heavy jargon of science needs to be made more comprehensible by storytellers and writers alike. The responsibility is simple, but it has crucial implications. Otherwise, we risk otherising everyone who isn't aware of the niche work presented within conferences and paywalled research journals. The communication aspect of science is a skill that requires concentrated effort to ensure that the message is clear and safe from blemishes. This much we understand of the responsibility of science communication. But there is an additional factor at play here. While the niche factor of science makes it difficult to communicate, the financial barriers of academia act as a fortress, concealing any and all knowledge generated within their journals. Take Nature — the world's leading science journal — which costs upwards of EUR 185 for a year's subscription. No part of this money, or really any money paid to journals, ends up in the scientists' pockets. The publishers take all, and thus they continue charging exorbitant prices for crucial scientific knowledge. Communication is a concept built around the idea of collaboration. When science is made inaccessible, either by the politics of academia or by simply being too niche, it alienates itself. Science has a duty to exist for the sake of a society that asks for help. Science communication builds trust between the scientific world and those who seek to benefit from it. The problem now remains in the fact that our political systems seem to thrive in the dearth of proper communication of science between scientists and non-scientists. To tackle this, an effort must be made head-on. Communities of scientists and teachers have a responsibility to establish the necessity of science communication to the youth. Youth organisations have a similar role to play, hosting workshops and establishing clubs that promote said activity. Even at a professional level, the importance of science communicators cannot be understated. Be it for the development of science itself or in how it is utilised, there is no denying that the current era is one that absolutely requires their presence.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/what-you-should-know-approaching-faculty-members-research-guidance-3873496","What you should know before approaching faculty members for research guidance","Conducting research of any form – be it for an independent project or your undergraduate thesis – is always a challenging task for any student. The task becomes even more challenging when students lack guidance in this regard. Therefore, it is crucial for young aspiring researchers to seek out proper guidance, ideally from faculty members. To do so, students must know how to approach a faculty member in the first place. One of the first things student should know when approaching a faculty member is that they are extremely busy. Between their teaching duties and their own research, faculty members are constantly having to juggle multiple responsibilities simultaneously. Hence, students should not expect them to make time for research discussions at a moment's notice. For Zahin Anan Haider, a final-year undergraduate student at BRAC University, finding a supervisor for her research work was a taxing experience. Faculty members who shared similar research interests as hers were not available to guide her as she failed to approach them earlier. She says, ""I reached out to the faculty members quite late. As a result, the professors who shared my research interests were unavailable. The one faculty member who was available had high expectations from the research, something my groupmates and I knew we could not meet at the time."" Zahin's statement is an important reminder for students that even if someone is available to supervise your research, they might not be thinking on the same level as you. In fact, it's only natural for faculty members to think of more advanced concepts or point out flaws in your research idea that you might not have noticed yourself. This also means that the longer you delay in approaching them, the harder it will become for you to work with them as you won't have the time to reach a middle ground where both of you are satisfied with the direction your research will be heading in.  Knowing what you want to do with your project is another important requirement of approaching a faculty member. According to Dr Syeda Nadia Hasan, an assistant professor from the Department of English at East West University, ""One common mistake students make when approaching faculty members is that they are unsure of what they want to do; specifically, the lack of adequate content knowledge of their preferred field poses a problem. Moreover, many students assume that research is a simple task of quoting and integrating other source materials into one's own work. Nothing disappoints or frustrates faculty members more than when they identify a lack of seriousness and integrity in aspiring researchers."" Students must also be mindful of the specific qualities that a faculty member may look for in aspiring researchers. Dr Mohammod Moninoor Roshid, a professor at the Institute of Research and Education, Dhaka University says, ""Multiple factors come into play when I decide if I want to guide or assist a student with their research. Some of the factors that I like to look into are their interest, potential in the field of research, and language skills to convey their findings objectively to the academic community,"" Dr Roshid feels that students should demonstrate their research potential through skills such as being able to produce good literature reviews and collect data. He elaborates, ""A student's capacity to do coherent literature reviews and data collection can help faculty members in understanding their prospect in the research arena."" Students often assume that in order to approach a faculty member for research collaboration in any capacity would require them to have a good CGPA. However, Dr Roshid thinks students' motivation plays the most vital role here. He states, ""CGPA can be a factor. However, it is certainly not the most important factor. In my career, I have encountered students who have good CGPAs but are not interested in research. On the other hand, I have also found students who are average academically but very focused when it comes to research work.""  Emphasising the factor of motivation, Dr Hasan adds, ""Nurturing interests is an integral part of doing research. Hence, students who exhibit an intrinsic desire to conduct research will impress their professors. Moreover, students need to be mindful of other important factors, such as having an adequate grasp of the topic and some basic technical knowledge of step-by-step research procedures. Students are most likely to rely on their professors' expertise while collaborating. However, having a mindset or an attitude that promotes self-learning will be an effective way to let professors know that students may continue to grow as independent researchers besides playing a secondary role in collaboration. Furthermore, other qualities such as hard work, patience, and integrity are key attributes for building research capacity that students can cultivate before approaching professors."" As evident from the discussion above, before you approach a faculty member for their guidance on your research or project, you need to be well-prepared in certain ways. Timing, patience, and your own understanding of the topic of your project or research are all key factors. Approaching your professor or lecturer with these things in mind will help you get the guidance you need for your research. Fariha Lamisa is a struggling student.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/five-uk-universities-offering-scholarships-bangladeshi-students-the-2025-september-session-3873486","Five UK universities offering scholarships to Bangladeshi students for the 2025 September session","Bangladeshi students aspiring to go abroad have always kept the United Kingdom (UK) as one of their top study-abroad destination choices. The quality of education, the international acceptance of a UK degree, the two-year post-study work permit, and many other factors make the UK a great place to study. For students who are considering going to the UK to pursue their higher studies, a key factor to consider is the finances required to do it. The financial burden may seem too high at times for students and that's why some universities provide partial scholarships to ease that burden and allow students to pursue their study abroad dreams. Here are some UK universities that provide scholarships for which Bangladeshi students are eligible. University of Sussex, a public research university located in East Sussex, England, is offering the ""Sussex Bangladesh Scholarship"" worth GBP 4,000 for graduate applicants and GBP 4,500 over three years for undergraduate applicants from Bangladesh in the form of tuition reduction. There is no limit on the number of scholarships available and it is applied automatically when you receive an offer of a place to study at the university. The confirmation of the scholarship will be sent by email after receiving the offer. Students, however, must be self-financing to be eligible for the scholarship, and the awards cannot be combined with any other Sussex-funded scholarship. The deadline to apply for the scholarship is September 1, 2025. University of Surrey, a public research university in Surrey, England, is offering the ""International Excellence Award"" worth GBP 5,000 for international students applying for both postgraduate and undergraduate programmes in the form of a tuition fee reduction. To secure the scholarships, students must have an offer from the University of Surrey and complete the scholarship application form. The scholarship is merit-based and its recipients are decided by the scholarship awards panel. The application deadline for this scholarship is July 31, 2025. Cardiff University is a public research university located in Cardiff, Wales, and a member of the prestigious Russell Group. They are offering the ""Vice-Chancellor's International Scholarship 2025"" which is worth GBP 10,000 in the form of tuition fee reduction for international students applying for selected postgraduate courses from Bangladesh. To secure the scholarships, students must have an offer from Cardiff University and pay any required deposit by the date specified on their offer letter. No separate application for the scholarship is required. The exact deadline for the scholarship will be mentioned in the student's offer letter.  The University of Glasgow, a public research university located in Glasgow, Scotland, and a member of the prestigious Russell Group, is offering the ""World Changers Glasgow Scholarship"" for applicants from various countries including Bangladesh. The scholarship is worth GBP 5,000 in the form of a tuition fee reduction. The scholarship is available for students applying to select postgraduate programmes and no separate application for the scholarship is required. Students will be sent a communication confirming their scholarship after they receive their offer. Leeds Beckett University, a public university in Leeds, England, is offering the ""Leeds Law School International Scholarship"" worth GBP 6,750 per year over the course of three years for undergraduate LLB applicants and GBP 6,500 for students applying for LLM courses in the form of tuition fee reduction. In order to avail the scholarship, students must be enrolled in an eligible course and meet other eligibility criteria, such as being self-funded and studying that level of the course for the first time. Scholarships are offered automatically if you meet the eligibility criteria and the discount will be deducted from tuition fees. Tamjidul Hoque is a UK LLB Graduate.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/childhood-the-middle-east-and-navigating-life-back-home-3873616","A childhood in the Middle East and navigating a life back home","In recent decades, the rapid economic expansion in the Middle East, driven by oil revenues and initiatives to diversify economies, has generated job opportunities and attracted migrants seeking a better life. Today, approximately 43 million people in the Middle East-North Africa region were born in another country or territory. Among them, around 3.6 million immigrants are from Bangladesh, residing primarily in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with smaller populations in Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Jordan.   The children of these expats mostly study in embassy-run schools, which either follow the British Curriculum or the National Curriculum of Bangladesh. Tahasina Tasnim Afra, a graduate of Bangladesh International School-Muscat, said, ""I sat for my O level and A level exams under the Pearson Edexcel board. My classes were mostly conducted in English. It might come off as a surprise, but I do not speak a word of Arabic, even after living in Oman my entire life. From my experience, many expats I've met in the Arab world also know only a few words but not enough to speak fluently. I feel that this language barrier is one of the primary factors contributing to the Arab–non-Arab segregation.""  Adding to this conversation, Md Ahad, an alumnus of Bangladesh International School-Riyadh, and currently a manager at Factory Makabes Al Sharq for Metal Products, said, ""I studied under the Bangla medium curriculum until HSC. We even sat for the exams at the exact time students in Bangladesh did.""  Ahad also noted, ""Our teachers were Bangladeshi migrants like us."" However, Shazzadur Rahman, a software engineer and a former student of Bangladesh International School-Riyadh, pointed out, ""The teacher-student ratio was off. There would be only one or two teachers for each subject.""  He further explained, ""The only teachers available to teach the curriculum were the school teachers. As a result, we had to go for private tuition under these very same teachers. Unlike students in Bangladesh, who had the flexibility to learn from different teachers if they struggled to understand their current ones, we were stuck with the same set of teachers.""  ""Moreover, since we were studying under the national curriculum, our competition was not supposed to be just with our peers inside the classroom in Riyad,"" said Ahad. ""Our competition was actually on a much larger scale, but we never got to realise that. Students in Bangladesh compete with their neighbours, cousins, and so on. Healthy competition is beneficial. It pushes one to improve further and stay in the habit of studying regularly. An absence of that leads to a lack of motivation,"" said Shazzad. ""Unlike Saudi Arabia and Oman, Kuwait doesn't have an embassy-run Bangladeshi school,"" informed Hashmita, a Bangali-Filipino born and raised in the State of Kuwait. ""I studied in an Indian school and completed my education under the CBSE board,"" said Hashmita. ""As a result, I did not really know much about the culture and heritage of Bangladesh. As a matter of fact, I came to learn about the liberation war of Bangladesh and the atrocities committed by the Pakistani army after taking a Bangladesh Studies course in my first semester of university,"" added Hashmita.   Bangladeshi students in the Middle East typically study there until the 12th grade before moving to Bangladesh for their undergraduate studies, while their families often remain behind. Afra further said, ""There are a few decent universities in Oman. The ones that are worth considering charge very high tuition fees to the international students compared to the locals. I had no other choice but to shift back to Bangladesh and made up my mind to sit for the medical admission test."" Shazzad said, ""It is the same case in Saudi Arabia where I feel that the quality of undergraduate education isn't as great. Compared to that, Bangladeshi universities are doing far better. The only difference with Oman is that the tuition fee for a bachelor's degree is equally expensive for both locals and expats in Saudi Arabia. I can study at top-tier private universities in Bangladesh at half that price."" Shazzad also said, ""Saudi Arabia is a great option for master's and PhD programmes though, and universities attract students from all over the world, including the United States.""   The admission season in Bangladesh lasts for about three to four months at most. It is crucial to utilise this period efficiently to secure a seat at one's target university. However, for many students returning from the Middle East, adjusting to a new environment during this critical phase poses significant challenges.  Shazzad highlighted this difficulty, saying, ""It's impossible to focus entirely on studying when a large part of this period is spent just trying to adjust to the surroundings.""  For some, the living situation made the transition even harder. Afra shared, ""I had to stay at a relative's place during the admission phase, but they made me feel very unwelcome. I missed my parents dearly, and the food didn't suit me at all. I vomited more times than I could count.""  Echoing Afra's struggles, Hashmita added, ""I also fell sick regularly and even fainted once. When I saw a doctor, he told me I wasn't getting enough nutrients from my diet. Ironically, I was eating more food here than I did in Kuwait, but the average diet here simply isn't as nutrient-rich.""  Aside from health and emotional struggles, transportation was another major adjustment for returning students.  ""In Saudi, we had our own car for commuting,"" said Shazzad. ""Suddenly having to rely on public transport was a huge inconvenience in the beginning. On top of that, Dhaka is notorious for its traffic. I was not prepared for how many hours I would have to waste just sitting in traffic.""  Hashmita also shared her shock at the chaotic traffic situation. ""People here are less eager to follow traffic rules,"" she said. ""Once, a bus got so close to the CNG I was in that I thought I was going to die. The driver just laughed and told me, 'This is how people drive in Bangladesh.' In Kuwait, cars stop to let pedestrians cross. Here, if I stop, the car will run over me,"" she sighed.  These struggles inevitably affected students' performances in their entrance exams.  Shazzad added, ""On top of these challenges, we were already behind compared to the local admission candidates, who had been preparing diligently for at least two to three years. That certainly didn't help. I remember feeling completely lost in the early days of my preparation.""  For some expatriate students, the challenges began even earlier due to a lack of access to information about the admission process.  Ahad shared, ""I wasn't even aware that the admission season had started in Bangladesh. One of the biggest drawbacks of being an expatriate is that we tend to miss out on crucial information like this.""  He explained that he only found out about the exams by chance. ""I had travelled to Bangladesh to resolve a passport issue. After landing, I learned that the Faculty of Business Studies at Dhaka University was about to conduct its admission exam. The only reason I am a Dhaka University graduate today is because the stars aligned in my favour,"" he elaborated.   Students who studied under a foreign curriculum faced additional hurdles when applying to their desired universities in Bangladesh. One of the biggest challenges was obtaining an equivalence certificate. An equivalence certificate shows the converted 10th and 12th qualifications to the National Curriculum standard.   Hashmita shared her experience, ""While students from the British curriculum also need to go through this process, it is much easier for them because many students follow that curriculum. As a result, university authorities are familiar with the conversion process. Since very few students from the Indian curriculum come to Bangladesh for higher education, the university authorities were unfamiliar with how to handle my case. This led to a lengthy and complicated procedure for me. I had to appear before a jury of six to seven members, who carefully reviewed my transcripts, passport, and other official documents. They also asked me numerous questions. The entire process lasted an entire day and was extremely exhausting.""  Many students returning from the Middle East also struggle to adapt to the university environment in Bangladesh. Hashmita said, ""Since I am part Filipino and part Bangali, my parents chose English as the primary language at home. My classes in Kuwait were also conducted in English, so my Bangla is not as strong as I would have liked.""  She added, ""I struggle to keep up with my classes since they are usually conducted in a mix of Bangla and English.""  Another challenge these students face is difficulty in relating to their peers. Afra said, ""Our life experiences shape who we become. They influence our likes, dislikes, and sense of humour. Because of this, I find it hard to connect with people here.""  Hashmita added, ""My closest friend in university is an expatriate from Saudi Arabia. I feel he is the only one who truly understands the struggles I am going through, especially that constant feeling of being out of place.""  For other students, universities provide their first experience of a diverse environment. Ahad said, ""Our classes in Riyadh were segregated by gender, and our classmates came from similar socio-economic and religious backgrounds.""  He added, ""Bangladesh, by comparison, is a very diverse country where people of different religions coexist. There are people from many indigenous communities here as well. As a result, classroom discussions offered new perspectives and were a breath of fresh air.""  Although these students' families used to stay behind when they moved to Bangladesh for university, this is rarely the case anymore. ""Oman had temporarily suspended dependency visas for Bangladeshis and later increased the visa costs, making it difficult for many families to continue living in Oman,"" mentioned Afra.   A similar trend can be seen in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as the entire Middle East undergoes reformation. Hashmita said, ""Kuwait is undergoing Kuwaitisation – a policy ensuring that Kuwaiti nationals get more job opportunities and reducing reliance on foreign workers. They started laying off expats, refusing to stamp working visas for those over the age of 65.""  ""As my father was over 65, our visas soon expired, and my family had to relocate,"" added Hashmita. Hashmita also mentioned, ""My mother is a working woman, and she was below 65. Yet, they refused to renew the visa as the husband is considered to be the sole breadwinner even if both spouses are in the workforce. The dependency visas are registered under his name.""   Shazzad said, ""A lot of rules have been changed recently in Saudi Arabia, which exponentially increased living costs and compelled many families to move back to Bangladesh. Additionally, many government institutions started getting acquired by private companies. They started implementing new rules and regulations. Thus, our family had to shift back to Bangladesh as the family visa got cancelled."" Many of these students have expressed a desire to move back to the Middle East if given the opportunity. Shazzad said, ""Living in Saudi Arabia would allow me to perform Umrah more frequently.""  Others want to return because of the safety and security offered by Middle Eastern countries. Afra said, ""I had my own driving license in Oman and used to travel freely with my friends. Given the rise in violence against women and the cases I hear about in the news, I can't imagine travelling alone here.""  However, securing a job in the Middle East as a foreigner is not easy, especially when there is no longer a family member back there. Ahad explained, ""Saudi Arabia operates on a referral system. Job hirings aren't as open to foreigners – it's a much more gated process. Openings aren't publicly announced, and foreigners cannot just apply anywhere. Having a referral from a Saudi national significantly helps.""  He added, ""Moreover, getting professional degrees like Chartered Accountant (CA) and Certified Management Accountant (CMA) accredited costs around BDT 2 to 4 lakhs. Professionals such as engineers must also pass a licensing exam before they can officially use their titles.""  However. for many of these students, these countries were home, even if temporarily. Nevertheless, the transition is one that is often complex and may have far-reaching impacts on the concept of home itself, and the ideas of their own identities. Afra shared, ""Sure, the Middle East has its flaws, just like anywhere else. But it has been my home for most of my life. I know I'm not an Arab, yet I don't feel like a local here either. It is a complicated identity to navigate.""  Echoing Afra's sentiment, Hashmita added, ""It would be nice to visit sometimes, but Kuwait doesn't grant visiting visas to Bangladeshis easily. The application window opens only occasionally, sometimes after years.""  Tazrin is a contributing writer at The Daily Star. Send her well wishes at [email protected]

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/bored-tunnelers-the-top-six-elon-musks-not-boring-competition-3870311","Bored Tunnelers in the top six of Elon Musk’s “Not a Boring Competition”","Team Bored Tunnelers has proudly secured a place among the top six teams in the 2025 edition of Elon Musk's ""Not-a-Boring Competition"", placing Bangladesh among the top four countries in the competition. This is a historic achievement for the nation as Bored Tunnelers was the sole representative from Asia. What started as a dream between three friends – Shaekh Mohammed Shithil, Shahriar Iqbal Mahim, and Fahin Uddin Enam – has now become a national symbol of innovation. Formed back in 2023, the team has grown into a group of over 30 young engineers and students, uniting talents from ten different universities across Bangladesh. Together, they took on one of the most challenging engineering competitions in the world, hosted by The Boring Company – founded by Elon Musk – in Bastrop, Texas. Last year, they won the prestigious 'Rookie Award"", making their entrance into the competition noteworthy. The competition spanned from March 24 to March 30 and included several technical rounds before the final ""Dig Day"" round. On the first day, teams had to present their ""Mining Readiness Review (MRR)"", showcasing their overall preparation. They also visited key parts of The Boring Company's facilities, including the famous PRUFROCK-3 and PRUFROCK-4 tunnel boring machines. In the following days, each subsystem of the team's machine – hydraulics, electrical, mechanical, and software – was thoroughly inspected. Through these inspections, Bored Tunnelers had to prove that their design could withstand the real challenges of boring underground. The final testing and digging race involved each team's tunnel boring machine being put to the test to see which one could dig the most and safest as well as navigate the best. ""Each year, the bar gets higher,"" said Nafis Ashraf, the team lead. ""And what makes the 'Not-a-Boring Competition' stand apart from other competitions is that this competition itself involves a unique learning curve. The Boring Company engineers constantly work with each team, guide them to bring out the best results, and ensure that the machines' cutterheads bore into the ground. If a team can't check all the boxes of a certain sub-system inspection in one day, they give them more time and later come back to check the improvements the team made on the spot."" For a team coming from a developing country with limited access to high-end R&D infrastructure, their journey was far from easy. But this only made the appreciation they received even more meaningful. ""Our cutterhead was the best in the competition,"" said Md Apu Bhuiyan, the team's head of manufacturing. ""The cutterhead – the rotating front part of the machine that breaks through the ground – was praised not only for its efficiency but also for how cleverly it was engineered under resource constraints."" The team's vice-president, Iqbal, added, ""Our team is the first ever team in Bangladesh that brought together a bunch of students to work on a closed R&D setup like tunneling technology. We have recently tested our machine at the MRT Line-5 depot at Hemayetpur, thanks to Dr Moshiur sir. This type of real-world testing is crucial to understand where theory meets practice and where it often fails."" Tunnel boring machines (TBMs) might not be a new technology, but in today's world, they are more important than ever. As urban populations grow rapidly and roads become increasingly congested, the need for underground transport solutions is becoming urgent. TBMs offer a way to expand infrastructure in crowded cities without disrupting the surface. Bangladesh, too, is undergoing a major infrastructural transition with several mega projects in place. The success of Bored Tunnelers shows that the country doesn't just have to depend on foreign technology; it can build its own. The potential of TBMs extends far beyond urban metro systems. Mega TBMs can help address some of the most critical global challenges. For instance, underground waste management systems using TBMs can transform how cities handle garbage disposal and sanitation, keeping the surface clean while processing waste underground in an automated fashion. Similarly, flood tunnels constructed beneath cities can serve as crucial buffers to prevent waterlogging during monsoon or cyclonic events, especially relevant for a flood-prone country like Bangladesh. TBMs are also essential in mining operations, including future missions for undersea resource extraction. Team Bored Tunnelers' journey has also opened doors for investments and support in deep-tech innovation in Bangladesh. Under the guidance of forward-thinking advisors, there is a renewed push to fund and promote R&D-based projects. Initiatives like Bored Tunnelers are exactly the kind of projects that can drive Bangladesh into the future. The team's partnership with Grameenphone has also played a key role in making this year's participation possible. Their financial and logistical support helped maintain the team's presence in Bastrop, Texas, for the second year in a row. With more refined machines, new recruits, and bigger goals, the team is determined to push robotics and tunnelling innovation in Bangladesh to the next level. As their story illustrates, with the right blend of passion, teamwork, and support, even the most ambitious dreams can be built, one tunnel at a time.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/career/news/your-guide-landing-job-international-development-organisation-3868221","Your guide to landing a job at an international development organisation","Have you ever dreamt of working with an international organisation? The idea of contributing to the sector of global development can be both thrilling and daunting. When I first considered pursuing a career in this field, I had no clear idea where to begin. However, as I explored further, I realised that although international organisations have their own unique structures, the process of applying for a role in one of them is not too different from any other job. For starters, looking for a role in such organisations is fairly easy. This is because the information required to apply tends to be accessible. Platforms such as LinkedIn, UN Careers, and UN Volunteers offer direct access to job listings from international organisations, making it easier than ever to find opportunities in international development organisations. All the job seekers have to do is seek out a role that match their skills and apply accordingly.   Lamia Mohsin, a reporting and knowledge management associate at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Bangladesh, offered valuable insights into navigating the international development career landscape. According to Lamia, ""Soft skills are critical for navigating the complexities of international development. Some of the most important ones include adaptability, the ability to work in diverse contexts, critical thinking, and, above all, empathy."" These skills are essential because international development requires professionals who can adjust to different environments while engaging with various cultures and dealing with global challenges. For those considering a career in international development, it's important to understand that the route can vary based on individual interests. Lamia explained that the sector offers a wide range of roles, from policy and advocacy to research, communications, and programme implementation. ""Progression typically involves gaining field experience, networking, and taking on leadership roles. Many professionals transition from local non-governmental organisations to regional or international roles before moving on to senior positions within international organisations such as the UN,"" she explained. While there is no single route to success, gaining experience and expanding your network is essential for advancing in this field. One factor that can play a role in securing a position at an international development organisation is referrals. Lamia acknowledged that referrals can be advantageous. However, she stressed that referral alone will not secure a role. ""Even internal candidates have to qualify in an extremely competitive merit-based selection process involving several stages of written and viva assessments. Referrals can help, but they do not guarantee a job,"" she added. The process of applying to international organisations, particularly the UN, can seem challenging to many. As Lamia puts it, ""The initial stage of CV screening is extremely rigorous as candidates must have relevant academic and work experience to be able to progress to the next stage."" Hence, for aspiring candidates, it's essential to ensure your qualifications align with the specific requirements of the role, or you may risk not being shortlisted. Now, there's a notion that international organisations often offer high salaries and that the work is glamorous. However, this may not be entirely true. ""People simply assume the work is glamorous and high-paying, or that a master's degree guarantees a job. In reality, the job is stressful and may often require individuals to stay away from their families, especially in the case of international assignments or missions. Experience, networking, and specialised skills matter as much as, if not more than, academic credentials,"" said Lamia. For those just starting out in their careers, Lamia offered advice on the types of qualifications needed to enter the field. She said, ""A bachelor's degree is usually required for entry-level roles, but a master's is often preferred for mid- and senior-level positions. For research or advisory roles, PhDs in relevant disciplines are often preferred."" Lamia further added that an undergraduate degree, combined with relevant work experience, particularly through internships or fellowships, can also open doors to entry-level opportunities. ""Volunteering with NGOs, participating in UN programmes like UN Volunteers, or engaging in grassroots initiatives are excellent ways to develop both soft and hard skills. Roles that involve research, writing, and public speaking are especially beneficial for those hoping to work in this field,"" she remarked. The most rewarding part of working in international development is knowing your work has a tangible impact. ""Even small, micro-level improvements in the fight against climate change can be incredibly rewarding. The opportunity to engage in high-level discussions and contribute to interventions that improve communities is deeply fulfilling. Working with people from all over the world has also made me more appreciative of cultural diversity and inclusion,"" said Lamia. With that being said, priorities at international development organisations can shift over time. Those looking to build a career in this field need to adjust to the needs of the organisation they are working for accordingly. Lamia notes, ""In the past decade, there has been a growing demand for green jobs, especially in areas like climate change and energy transition. However, the volatility of sector-specific jobs is also evident, influenced by factors like funding constraints and geopolitical instability."" For those considering a career in an international organisation, Lamia's advice is straightforward but invaluable: ""Gain field experience, build as many networks as possible, follow global policy trends and issues, and have an open-minded approach towards exploring different career pathways."" The world of international development is a dynamic and evolving field, offering countless opportunities to make a difference. While there is no rigid path to success in this field, developing adaptability, continuously learning, and remaining passionate about creating positive change will guide you through your career journey.","Sat Apr 12, 2025 05:00 PM         Last update on: Sat Apr 12, 2025 05:00 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/education/news/oa-levels-undergrad-does-early-exposure-computer-science-matter-3868211","From O/A levels to undergrad: Does early exposure to Computer Science matter? ","Computer Science has become one of the fastest-growing academic disciplines in recent years, with promising prospects in fields like software development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. More students are choosing to study Computer Science in their O and A levels in an effort to obtain a competitive edge for their future academic endeavours, especially if they wish to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science (CS) or Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), as both parents and students recognise the field's growing importance. This raises an important question: is O/A level Computer Science a springboard to undergraduate success, or can students without this foundation excel just as well? ""It definitely gives you a head start. Knowing the basics helped me grasp more complex concepts much more easily,"" says Ahnaf Islam, a Computer Engineering major at the University of South Florida, who studied both O and A level Computer Science. ""However, that initial advantage only takes you so far. Eventually, it stops making a difference as you dive into more advanced topics that require a deeper level of understanding and application. If you are consistent with your studies, you shouldn't really worry at all. Universities assume you know next to nothing about Computer Science when you begin your studies, and you won't really miss out on any of the basics."" The initial stages of an undergraduate CS/CSE degree might be intimidating for students with no prior experience. Even if universities create their curricula to accommodate students from different backgrounds, some students could still find it difficult to understand computational thinking or coding. Alternative learning options, such as coding boot camps, online courses, and self-study materials like Harvard's CS50 or websites like LeetCode and Udemy, can help close the gap. Sheikh Arifin Ahmed, a Computer Science student at BRAC University, reflects on his own experience: ""I really wish I had some exposure to Computer Science before starting university. Grasping coding concepts was tough for me at first, as I was completely new to the subject, having never studied it during my O/A levels. However, after working hard for a few weeks, I could overcome a lot of my struggles with CS."" However, while subjects like Mathematics, Pure Sciences, and Economics have well-established teaching resources, O/A level Computer Science is still a relatively niche choice in many schools, with limited access to qualified teachers. ""I think studying A level Computer Science would have been more fruitful if my peers and I had the necessary resources, support, and qualified teachers. We mostly had to self-study and teach ourselves and each other,"" says Partha Pritom Ghosh, a second-year student at the University of British Columbia majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. However, he still sees value in taking the subject. ""A level Computer Science didn't directly help much in my undergraduate studies because the teaching approach was quite different, and we started from the basics again. However, it did give me a sense of what to expect. Even minimal help can make a difference, so if you're planning to study Computer Science further, O/A level CS is a valuable start, especially if you put in the effort to practise."" A common misconception is that early exposure to CS is only about learning to code. However, the field of Computer Science as a whole includes much more than just programming; it also includes algorithmic thinking, problem-solving, and even abstract mathematical ideas like discrete mathematics and graph theory. Some students may struggle in university, not because they lack coding experience, but because they are unprepared for the theoretical depth required in subjects like data structures, automata theory, and computational complexity. Muhammad Masrur Ahmed, now pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at North South University, shares: ""The foundational concepts I picked up in O level Computer Science turned out to be more useful than the advanced topics we studied in A level. University courses tend to revisit and build upon the basics in much greater depth, so having a solid grasp of those fundamentals really makes a difference. The A level syllabus, though more advanced, often presents topics in a way that doesn't align with how CS is taught at university."" In the end, choosing to do Computer Science for O/A levels should be motivated more by personal interest than by a sense of necessity for success in college. While gaining early exposure to the field can help build a foundation and ease the transition to undergraduate coursework, it is not essential for excelling in university. Many top CS professionals and researchers started their journeys later in life, often using self-learning as a tool to catch up. Most university programmes are designed to teach from the ground up, meaning prior knowledge isn't mandatory. However, approaching the subject with genuine enthusiasm can make the process much more fulfilling. So, if you feel excited by the prospect of understanding how algorithms work, exploring the inner workings of a computer, or coding your first programme, then you can go ahead and take that leap. But if your passion lies elsewhere, trust that there are many paths to success and fulfilment, and the best one is the one you truly enjoy walking.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/art-side-hustle-and-the-students-who-make-it-work-3867251","Art as a side hustle and the students who make it work","We're often told that in order to retain the enjoyability of our hobbies, we should refrain from turning them into a means of income. While this sentiment is not unfounded, turning our hobbies into sources of income often means that we'll enjoy our downtime and simultaneously earn some cash. Of course, implementing this in reality isn't as easy as it sounds, especially for students who have academic responsibilities to carry out, as running a business takes up a great portion of time. That isn't to say there aren't students who make it work. Running a business full-time is not feasible for most, but many students throughout the country have their own side hustles going. From selling baked goods or home-cooked foods to putting original artworks on sale- students have almost all bases covered. Selling artwork and crafts, specifically, is becoming more and more popular by the day. This can include digital and physical art such as canvas paintings and portraits, jewellery, crocheted items, trinkets, hand-embroidered items, etc. Some choose to utilise unorthodox art mediums as well, such as painting on stones or logs or other everyday items. Social media lends students a lucrative platform to advertise and sell their products. Many artists have gotten their start by sharing a simple photo of their creations, and the enthusiastic reception from friends and acquaintances has given them the confidence to take on their business venture. Lahmee Tairim, a student of Finance at Dhaka University, is one such artist. Lahmee owns a page called bakbakummm on Instagram and Facebook, where she shares and sells embroidered crafts such as jewellery, wall hangings, and other accessories. Being interested in needlework since childhood, she picked it back up as a way to fill her idle time, drawing inspiration from Pinterest and other platforms. When she shared her work on her personal social media pages, she received encouragement as well as customised orders from friends and acquaintances. This influenced her to start selling her craft, noticing a lack of embroidered jewellery in the market. However, being a full-time student, she has to work around her academic duties and is forced to limit herself to a certain number of orders per month. ""I love needlework, creating new designs using a needle is very fun, so I run this page as a hobby. Hence, I don't take that many orders, only about 15-16 pieces a month on average. Because of academics, I don't invest a lot of time in my tiny business. I spend around three to four hours on each piece."" Other than social media, fairs and festivals organised in universities is a good way for students to get their start. Tahsina Islam, a student of Pharmacy at BRAC University (BRACU), started her business at the fairs and events organised by the institution. Since then, she has branched her business outside her university, attending fairs hosted by other universities as well, and growing her online page. Her stall, Protikritii, is a versatile one where you can find paintings on canvases, wood, and stone, as well as resin jewellery, key charms, and various other craft items. ""My friends were my biggest inspiration, whenever I crafted something new, they would tell me to start a business. When I saw students running their stalls at BRACU's fests, I decided to give it a try. Since my products are handmade, it's difficult to run a business on the side when my academics are on full throttle, which is why I'm not very active on my online page. When there's a fest imminent at BRACU, North South University, or East West University, I work for about 10-12 hours at a time. Generally, there's at least one fest a month, so I end up generating enough money for my pocket allowance and caretaking of my pets,"" says Tahsina. Tahsina has plans for expansion beyond fairs and fests, hoping to one day run a showroom of her handmade products. Many students consider their small business a start for something they can hopefully grow into a much bigger venture. Owning a business is a beacon of hope for many as they seek to escape the cookie-cutter 9 to 5 life. Nafisa Alam Toree, a student of Business and Technology Management at the Islamic University of Technology and the owner of Arts by Toree, hopes to expand her small business of selling paintings and focus on it long term. Finding catharsis in her art, she started her business with the motto ""colours have the healing power"". Nafisa shares, ""I learned how to paint as a kid, but had to stop during college. Thanks to the immense pressure during my admission phase, I sought escape in my paintings. Encouragement from friends and family kept me going as I started selling paintings of the sky and mandalas. Eventually, faceless portraits based on photos sent in by customers became my most popular products, and I plan on expanding my art to other media as well."" While some have concrete plans to take their endeavours to higher heights in the future, some are just enjoying the ride as they go. Zakia Sultana Zannat, a former student of Mirpur Girls College, runs a page called crochetouille.co, where she sells her crocheted items. ""I used to make crocheted items for my friends as birthday gifts and eventually decided that I could try to get some money out of it since I didn't have any other jobs. I like crocheting, and so I thought maybe I could make people happy by making them customised crocheted products. I don't have a lot of followers yet, but I have had wonderful experiences with customers and even made new friends through running this business,"" Zakia says. Crocheting is a time-consuming and intricate craft. While some products can be completed within two hours, Zakia says that some may take up to 48 hours, which is why the biggest challenge she faces is delivering her products on time. She adds, ""Growing my business eventually would be nice, but I'm not thinking of that yet as I am content with the work I do, and I would rather not compromise the quality of my work by taking too many orders at once. The name of my page is inspired by Ratatouille, which is a very cute and fun film. That is also how I want my page to be perceived, so the positive reviews and happiness of my customers upon receiving their products is what keeps me going."" A recurring theme found in the anecdotes of all these artists is that profit tends to take a backseat for them, fulfilment and accessibility being their priority. Although most of their businesses have a certain profit margin, keeping prices student-friendly takes precedence. A general challenge while running a handmade product business is mass production. Most of these artists work alone, and a lot of time, love, and care goes into each piece. Depending on the nature of the craft, sourcing materials for products also often poses a challenge. In spite of the obstacles and arduous work, the owners and artists of these small businesses diligently maintain that the contentment they get from witnessing people enjoy their creations makes it all worthwhile. So whether you're someone who's hoping to start their own endeavour someday or simply an admirer of the arts, consider supporting small businesses.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/interests/news/eid-enchantments-and-us-3861076","Eid enchantments and us","A special cover of Rising Stars where we look back at how Eid has changed for us over the years.  Adrin Sarwar When I was a kid, Eid was all about new outfits, new shoes, mehendi, and a fresh hairstyle. Eid day meant hanging out with my cousins all day, enjoying chotpoti, and spending a chunk of the day in one of the corners of my granny's home with my favourite cousin. For a long time, that was Eid for me. But as I grew up, I realised Eid wasn't just about the clothes, salami, or sneaking a peek at the new pair of shoes in the middle of the night. In fact, Eid changed when that cousin of mine left for her education. It changed when we all stopped gathering at granny's. It changed as we fondly thought of those who were with us last Eid but not this one. With time, I've realised, Eid is about being surrounded by loved ones – and missing the ones who once held us close. It's about finding ways to keep them close to our hearts, even if they're no longer by our side. Azra Humayra Eid always was the best time of the year; I counted down the days like my life depended on it. The moon sighting felt like a sacred thrill. Once it appeared, I commandeered my mother's button phone, texting ""Eid Mubarak"" with far too many exclamation marks to every number I could find. Eid still feels like it did when I was a child – a jampacked day consisting of new clothes, shemai, and a happiness so overwhelming I can barely contain it. Now, I am older, taller, and more measured, but the giddy anticipation remains, as if time forgot to age that part of me. My father still wakes up early, still nudges me to get ready, and my mother still makes shemai in more variations than I once knew to appreciate – now I do. Now, I may get restless to return to Dhaka with so many things tied to my name, which little me would be so annoyed with. Fariha Lamisa Eid has always been described to me as the biggest and most joyous festival one can experience. For most of my life, this was my truth. However, since last year's Eid, my understanding of it has been unsettled by the life-altering pain of losing my father in an untimely death. Suddenly, Eid is no longer just about wearing new clothes, collecting salami, and enjoying a break from academic pressure. Instead, it has become about watching my teenage brother go to the mosque alone for his Eid prayer, seeing my aging mother manage everything single-handedly, and feeling the unspoken longing for a loved one within my family. Yes, it is mostly unspoken, the grief is too extreme to be translated in words. Yet, within this melancholy, I find a glimpse of hope, hope in my own survival. If I can endure the excruciating pain of losing a parent, maybe I can overcome anything. Now, Eid is not only about celebrating with my loved ones but also about missing one of them, adjusting to my father's absence, and embracing reality. It is about finding the courage to be happy despite the hurdles and holding on to the hope that life will be great. Ohona Anjum The sky roared as the sun peeked through the clouds, Eid morning drenched in rain. The veranda, slick with water and the kitchen thick with the scent of shemai simmering on the stove. Our hearts were fixed outside, beyond the curtain of rain, Billu waited. Curled up on the tin shed. We clutched our bowls of shemai, how could we reach him in such a downpour? But waiting wasn't enough. We plucked the biggest leaf we could find, giggling, we darted out into the rain, holding the leaf above our heads, feet splashing against the soaked earth. Billu blinked in surprise as we placed the bowl beside him. A deep purr, he lapped up the sweet treat. Mission accomplished. We raced back, hearts pounding. Our mothers couldn't know. We remained pressed against the wall, biting back laughter, pretending our dresses weren't damp, that our adventure had never happened. But the smiles. Those, we couldn't hide. Years later, on clear Eid mornings, I still search the sky for rain, still hear the rustle of a leaf, the splash of our tiny feet and those laughter dissolving into the wind, like childhood, that became clouds beyond reach.   Rafid Khandaker For as long as I can remember, Eid has started with me waking up to the aroma of ma's handmade shemai. Baba always made a point to wake us up three hours ahead of the Eid prayers, just so there was not even an inkling of a possibility of missing it. It didn't matter much, though, as I spent those three hours dozing off anyway. So instead of crinkling my pajamas, I crinkled my Eid clothes. My brother somehow managed to stay awake the whole time, despite both of us spending the entire night fighting over who would get to play World of Warcraft on the computer. As prayer time approached, all the men in our family would gather under our building, and we would set off for the Baitul Mukarram Mosque. The smell of attar and perfume adorning everyone's colorful panjabis was certain to jolt me out of my drowsiness. And with that, Eid had begun. The rest of the day would be filled with dawats; hopping from one house to another and filling up on enough jorda for the rest of the year. And it would all end with an uncharacteristically early bedtime. Tinath Zaeba Eid always arrived like the perfect guest – on time and bringing a flurry of sweet chaos. It began with henna-stained hands, milk thick enough to hold dreams, and cardamom whispering promises of something delicious. The kitchen was home to bubbling pots of shemai – made in abundance – not just for ourselves, but for the many hands that would reach for it, for the family that filled my home like the warmth of a sunlit morning. As a child, I stood beside my mother, stirring carefully, watching as the golden strands softened into something familiar, something shared. Now, just one pot simmers on the stove. Fewer bowls are set on the table, even fewer hands reach out, but the love remains the same. In the swirls of thickened milk and softened vermicelli, I still hear them – the murmured conversations, the greetings, the gentle clinking of spoons against porcelain. Time moves forward, carrying some away and leaving others behind, but in these small rituals of sweet nostalgia, they return, even if the people don't. Eid has changed, but perhaps its magic never truly leaves us. After all, every Eid, I spend so much time making shemai, a dessert I don't even like to eat. Punomi Rahman Titir The familiar scents of cardamom, glossy bundles and store-bought attar. The first light of the sun slants through the sheer curtains, pooling in the folds of an untouched prayer mat and beaded tasbeeh. The old microphone hanging from the four-storied minaret balcony of the local masjid summons at early six, crackling with a listlessness that does not quite reach the bones. Muazzin shaheb, holding the receiver a little too close as always, delivers the muffled sound of a repeated message most people do not clearly understand. We sleep through consecutive alarm slots before we rush to miss the early congregation. 'Eid Mubarak, dadijaan!' greetings exchanged at breakfast, while stretching an arm halfway across the dining table to scoop out another spoonful of misti payesh and lachcha shemai. From counting the smell of freshly minted bills, now counting heads and how many 100 taka notes your bare, tattered wallet could afford to spare, because Eider khushi evolves in ways that makes growing up feel just a little more dreadful. We still do visit friends and next-door neighbours, squashing spaces in our already-full stomachs to stuff room for another bowl of dessert. And our mehedi dries, new dresses lose their crisp lingered in sweat and bellies wobble with content. Somewhere, we still chase the night sky to catch fleeting glimpses of the barely hung Eid-er-Chand, disappearing through shifting clouds before we rush to bid the first salam. Somewhere else, the smog-filled haze swallows the crescent moon before we even think to look.","Mon Mar 31, 2025 06:38 AM         Last update on: Mon Mar 31, 2025 06:44 AM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/interests/news/saving-your-eid-salami-the-future-3861036","Saving your Eid salami for the future","Musing over the boundless joy of receiving eidi or salami is one of my favourite moments of Eid, and even more so back when I was little. As a child, however, I could never really figure out what to do with my Eid salami. So, I would usually end up treasuring the salami I had received inside my palm-shaped clay (or 'matir') bank, listening to the jangle of coins and the rustle of crisp banknotes for years on end. Much later, when I eventually cracked open the money jar, I was stirred by the overwhelming decision of how to spend my savings. Rather than spending it all on fleeting indulgences, my parents suggested I invest the amount purchasing gold jewellery. At the time, I might not have fully grasped the significance of such advice, but looking back, it was undoubtedly a wise financial decision. As Ramadan comes to an end and the Eid celebrations await, the time of the year, when scents of freshly minted banknotes stacked in glossy bundles fill the air (and our pockets) returns. Compulsive rituals of collectively tallying our monetary delights, stashing them away in excitement, and endless contemplations about future expenditures before pouring it all on momentary infatuations are all too familiar. But what if this year, and maybe going forward, you don't indulge in such expenditure? What if you were to save your Eid salami for later and also learn about saving money and managing finances from an early age? School banking accounts can be a gateway into the world of financial literacy for young savers. These saving accounts, designed specifically for school-going students, offer enticing interest rates – often higher than conventional saving accounts – that allow your savings to grow reasonably over time. Besides, the minimum initial deposit requirement is comparatively low – BDT 100 in most cases – making it accessible to start saving with any portion of your salami. It further allows kids from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds to open and maintain school banking accounts, fostering financial inclusion and education from an early age. Several banking services in Bangladesh offer saving schemes to students under 18 with multiple benefits tailored to their needs, including zero charges for account maintenance and no minimum balance fee. Apart from the usual student or school banking accounts, you should also explore banking schemes like fixed or double deposit schemes or any other option that allows you to save and receive interest on a one-time deposit amount. Be sure to consult your parents or guardians before you opt for such banking accounts or schemes.   Beyond just saving money, such banking services serve as a bridge between financial freedom and parental guidance. While students can access their funds and make their own decisions by availing debit card facilities and free ATM withdrawals, parents can monitor transactions and set withdrawal limits, ensuring spending remains responsible and aligned with necessary expenses. This balance allows young savers like you to cultivate independence while still having a safety net – a crucial step towards preparing them for future financial responsibilities. Saving your Eid salami instead of spending it on short-term purchases comes with plenty of advantages, the biggest of which is that it instils the habit of financial discipline from a young age. Setting aside money and watching it accumulate over time builds patience and an understanding of delayed gratification, which is an essential skill in handling finances as an adult. The earlier children are introduced to the practice of saving, the more likely they are to develop responsible financial behaviours that will benefit them throughout their lives. Saving up over the years can also help accumulate funds for larger investments. A child's first major purchase, such as a bicycle, a gadget, or a special gift for a loved one, can be financed through the careful saving of your Eid salami over the years. As the years go by, these early habits can pave the way for larger financial goals, such as funding educational expenses, travelling, or even starting a small business. The discipline of saving small amounts regularly leads to a mindset that values financial independence and long-term planning. Eid is a time of joy, generosity, and celebration, but it can also be an opportunity to reflect on the value of financial responsibility. Instead of viewing your Eid salami as mere pocket money to be spent impulsively, it can be seen as the foundation for a secure and financially independent future.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/movies-enjoy-eid-your-family-3857186","Movies to enjoy this Eid with your family","Eid is a time of spirituality, gratitude, and mindfulness. However, given how hectic life has become for many of us, it is also one of the only times when the whole family can come together, and celebrate the festivities with each other. To make this time somewhat more enjoyable, here are a few movies you can watch with your family. Sonar Kella Sonar Kella first introduced us to Feluda, Satyajit Roy's famous detective, on the silver screen, and needless to say, we instantly fell in love. The story focuses on Feluda as he attempts to rescue Mukul, a young boy plagued by memories of his past life, from a band of kidnappers. What follows is a sprawling adventure that involves a lost treasure, a camel chase, and some brilliant sleuthing. The storytelling is aided by various comic elements, including the presence of Feluda's sidekicks Topshe and Jatayu, making Sonar Kella a wonderful combination of thriller and comedy that can be a perfect movie to watch with your family on Eid. Makdee Chunni, a mischievous young girl in a small Indian village, feels no qualms about impersonating her twin sister to get out of trouble. However, when her antics land her sister in a haunted witch's mansion and cursed into the form of a hen, Chunni embarks on a quest to reverse her mistakes that leads to her uncovering an elaborate criminal ruse. Even though it is supposed to be a horror-comedy for children, Makdee also provides a moving social commentary on the dark underbelly of superstition in rural societies.  Coco Coco was perhaps the first Disney film released in a very long time that managed to capture me in the same way films like The Lion King, Little Mermaid, or Hercules did. Punctuated with enrapturing music numbers, filled with beautifully fleshed out characters, and complete with impossibly breathtaking visuals, Coco will make you and your family laugh, cry, and feel grateful for each other's company should you choose to watch it this Eid. Heerok Rajar Deshe Goopi Gain and Bhaga Bain, Satyajit Roy's superheroes-turned-princes who can entrance anyone with their singing abilities, return in this sequel to free the people of Heerok Rajar Desh from their tyrannical ruler. Cruel, dictatorial, and so deeply entrenched in his own lust for wealth and power that he is entirely desensitised to the sufferings of his subjects, the Heerok Raja embodies tyranny. However, even though it is packed with heavy political underpinnings, the movie is also a charming and fun experience for audience of all ages.","Sun Mar 30, 2025 10:00 PM         Last update on: Sun Mar 30, 2025 10:00 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/rising-stars/news/easy-eid-recipes-prepare-your-loved-ones-3857191","Easy Eid recipes to prepare for your loved ones","There's something magical about Eid mornings — the sound of laughter in the kitchen, the smell of something sweet bubbling on the stove, and the sight of everyone getting involved, even just to stir a spoon or set the table. Helping out at home during Eid isn't just about easing the load — it's about being part of the joy. And nothing brings people together quite like a shared meal. If you've been thinking of pitching in this year, here are five easy and familiar recipes that are always a hit on Eid. They're simple to prepare, perfect for beginners, and can be adjusted with ingredients you already have at home. Cool, creamy, and full of flavour, this pudding is perfect for a hot Eid afternoon, especially after a heavy meal. It's light on the stomach but still feels festive. The base is usually made with coconut water, sugar, and a setting agent like agar-agar or gelatin. To make it a little more creative, you can pour the mixture into a funky-shaped mould or silicone tray (I would recommend a crescent shaped mould for the perfect Eid-themed look). Once chilled and firm, pop them out and serve right before setting the dessert table after meals. It looks beautiful on the plate and is the perfect refreshing addition on a humid day. Additionally, you can top it off with coconut milk if you're opting for a richer flavour. Dates are already special during Eid, but stuffing them with various treats turns them into bite-sized treats that everyone loves. A classic version includes stuffing with roasted almonds or pistachios, either chopped or finely grinded. Another delicious option is stuffing dates with thickened milk (usually known as mawa or khoya) and rolling them in coconut. You can also mix crushed nuts with honey or add a small spoon of cream inside. If you're looking for a fragrant kick, add a pinch of cardamom powder. Another fun version is melting chocolate and coating the dates in it before rolling them over chopped nuts for added texture. Chill them before serving — they taste better cold and can easily be prepped the night before Eid. Chocolate mousse is rich, creamy, and always popular with younger guests. While the basic version uses whipped cream and melted chocolate, you can give it a fancier spin and make it a star. Try layering it with crushed Marie or Parle-G biscuits for a pudding-like texture. You can also add a hint of instant coffee for a mocha flavour or use Bournvita or Milo powder for more of a malt chocolate taste. A light sprinkle of crushed cashews or grated chocolate on top makes it look beautiful without much effort. Serve it in small glasses or mousse cups if you have them at home. Fruit custard is a colourful classic — cool, creamy, and easy to make in bulk. Start with making the custard base with milk and custard powder, then add your favourite fruits. Bananas, apples, grapes, and pomegranate are always safe choices, but mangoes and lychees add a more festive flavour. Many households like to add colourful jelly cubes or canned fruit cocktails. For a richer version, mix in a bit of condensed milk or a spoon of fresh cream. Some families even add a layer of chopped shemai or sponge cake at the bottom, turning it into a deshi-style trifle. As a savoury option, this is a quick and easy dish that can pack a punch of flavour. All you need is chickpeas and, while you can definitely bring variation to the ingredients, the basic ones would be tomatoes, potatoes, cucumber, and the greens (coriander, onions, and if you want a that fresh bite, mint leaves). If you don't have all of these ingredients, then don't worry; just add whatever you have with a dressing of olive oil. My favourite addition to this recipe is lemon juice and garnishing it with sliced paneer. This recipe always gets compliments for being fresh and crunchy. And the best part is that it is compatible with whatever Eid spread is going on for lunch or dinner. Helping out at home during Eid doesn't have to mean spending hours in the kitchen. Even simple tasks like chopping fruit, arranging dates, or garnishing pudding can bring joy — and lighten someone else's load.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/news/the-silent-struggles-adolescence-3860731","The silent struggles of adolescence","Until just a year or two ago, I often found myself saying, ""I hate teenagers."" I was one myself not too long ago, and so, to sound less hypocritical, I would add, ""I must have been just as annoying."" But when I truly reflected on my teen years, I felt pity more than anything else. As a teen, I thought I was ""cool,"" ""rebellious,"" and all those other clichéd ""teenage"" things. But only after growing up did I recognise my own cries for help, my denial of feeling lost because admitting it wasn't ""cool."" Today's teenagers can articulate their emotions better, yet they struggle, especially among their peers. My niece, on the brink of adolescence, sometimes tells her mother she feels like ""disappearing,"" but it is something she cannot tell a friend lest it makes her seem weak. Navigating teenagehood is a complex journey filled with self-discovery, confusion, and emotional turmoil. For adults, it can feel like trying to connect with someone from another world. But beneath the defiance and unpredictability is a young person desperate to understand themselves. That's why teenagers need patience and compassion, not dismissal. Netflix's Adolescence, starring Owen Cooper and Stephen Graham, captures this struggle with brutal honesty. Watching the series felt like a tonne of bricks dropping onto me. All I could think about was my niece and the internal battles she fights every day. The show's protagonist, Jamie (played by Owen Cooper), is convicted of murdering a female schoolmate after relentless online bullying branded him an ""incel"" (involuntary celibate). At just 13, Jamie is trapped between childhood and adulthood, desperate for independence yet in dire need of guidance. Before he can even process his emotions, he is pushed to commit a crime that, to him, feels justified. ""I've done nothing wrong,"" he repeats. Why does he think he did nothing wrong? Jamie was convinced that his actions were justified, as social media had shaped and skewed his perception of right and wrong, leading him to believe that responding with harm towards a woman who had mistreated him was acceptable behaviour. His story is a stark reminder of how today's teenagers are left to navigate their struggles in an unforgiving digital landscape. Teenagers today face challenges far beyond those of past generations. The internet and social media amplify external pressures and internal struggles, making adolescence even more turbulent. Real-life relationships, academic stress, and self-discovery are compounded by the relentless comparison, cyberbullying, and toxic online influences. Figures like Andrew Tate peddle misogynistic and hyper-masculine archetype, shaping the minds of impressionable teens. Teenage boys, desperate for direction, are drawn to these figures, while teenage girls often suffer the consequences. In this environment of online cruelty and unrealistic expectations, developing a secure sense of self becomes even harder. This is where compassion becomes essential. The lessons from Adolescence are clear: teenagers need understanding more than rules. Their desire for independence isn't rebellion; it's growth. Rather than viewing their actions as defiant or irrational, adults must recognise them as a natural part of self-discovery and vulnerability. By listening, supporting, and allowing room for mistakes, we help teenagers feel acknowledged, valued, and understood. More than ever, teenagers need adults who will meet them where they are, not where they ""should"" be. It's easy to dismiss a 13-year-old's emotions as melodrama, a 16-year-old's struggles as trivial, or an 18-year-old's frustrations as arrogance. But these are formative years when self-worth, relationships, and identity are still fragile. Without strong support, teenagers can be driven to dangerous corners of the internet, radicalised by harmful ideologies, or left feeling like their struggles don't matter. Instead of frustration or dismissiveness, we must approach teenagers with curiosity and care. We must have the difficult conversations, ask the unspoken questions, and create safe spaces for vulnerability. My niece already struggles to articulate emotions she doesn't fully understand, and I wonder: how different would Jamie's story have been if someone had truly listened before it was too late? We can't eliminate the pressures of growing up in a digital world, but we can counteract them with empathy. If we choose compassion over criticism, patience over punishment, and conversation over condemnation, we might just give teenagers the foundation they need to navigate their world without losing themselves in the process.","Sun Mar 30, 2025 11:09 AM         Last update on: Sun Mar 30, 2025 11:16 AM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus/news/bups-eggteavate-transforming-cafeteria-waste-sustainable-solutions-3859536","BUP’s EggTeaVate: Transforming cafeteria waste into sustainable solutions","Used tea bags and leaves are often discarded as waste, contributing to environmental pollution. Recognising this issue, Assistant Professor Arifur Rahman of Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP) envisioned a way to repurpose tea waste and eggshells into something beneficial. He shared his idea with BUP Lecturer Golam Muktadir, and together, they conceptualised EggTeaVate, a sustainable waste management initiative. The initiative quickly gained interest among students from BUP's Department of Environmental Science. A dedicated team, initially comprising Sadika, Taseen, Nabiha, Nusaiba, Arpita, and Fahim from the 2022 batch, took the lead in developing the project. Later, they were joined by Najla, Nashita, Arghya, Liza, and Tahiyat from the 2023 batch. Their primary goal was to create an innovative organic compost using discarded tea leaves and eggshells collected from university cafeterias. EggTeaVate is based on the widely recognised concept of kitchen waste composting but with a unique approach. The team collected, dried, and grounded eggshells, then mixed them with used tea leaves to develop organic fertilizer at one of BUP's laboratories. Experimental results demonstrated that calcium carbonate from eggshells strengthens plant cell walls and enhances flower and fruit production. At the same time, nitrogen and tannic acid from tea leaves improve soil fertility and promote plant growth. EggTeaVate is not just a waste management initiative; it is a highly effective organic fertilizer supplement. The compost enhances soil aeration and water retention, essential for plant health. It also provides a chemical-free alternative to synthetic fertilizers and boosts soil fertility through beneficial microorganisms, making it a sustainable and eco-friendly solution. By promoting zero-waste practices, EggTeaVate helps reduce landfill waste, supports a circular economy, and advocates for sustainable environmental solutions. While EggTeaVate has shown promising results, the initiative is still in its experimental phase, utilising only a small portion of cafeteria waste. The EggTeaVate team acknowledges that while composting is not a new concept, its implementation at the university level demonstrates a practical and scalable approach to sustainable waste management. With further development, BUP could move toward becoming a zero-waste campus, setting a benchmark for other institutions to follow.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/ramadan-young-professionals-away-home-3856491","Ramadan for young professionals away from home","Whenever I conjure a picture of Ramadan in my mind, I see a table full of food with my family gathered around it. I think of someone waking me up for sehri, the aroma of food filling the house as evening approaches, and of a time when the entire family gets to share a meal together. However, the picture isn't as colourful for everyone. For young professionals living away from home, Ramadan presents a bleak reality. While iftar tends to be a celebration for most, for them, it is just another meal. Often, even procuring a filling meal for iftar becomes a struggle. Abdullah Al Faiaz, a territory sales executive at a reputed multinational company who is currently posted at Madaripur, said, ""I'm having a tough time managing healthy meals for iftar."" ""After coming home from work, I am usually too exhausted to prepare anything. Here in Madaripur, it's very difficult to hire household help. Just the other day, after waking up 10 minutes before iftar, I simply warmed up a cup of noodles and that was essentially all I had,"" he added. The biggest challenge of living away from home is perhaps the change in the menu for sehri and iftar. Back at home, those who live with their families are accustomed to home-cooked meals for iftar. However, for someone living alone outside Dhaka, home-cooked food is a luxury. ""Whenever I'm in Feni, there's no specific menu for sehri anymore,"" said Tanvir Rafi, a cluster manager at Grameenphone, who's currently posted in Feni. ""Sometimes, it's just dates and water. Other times, I drink some water and go to sleep early without waking up for sehri. For iftar, I mostly have fruits and occasionally order takeout. The inconsistency and lack of discipline have taken a toll on my health. I don't get any sleep before sehri and feel lethargic all day. This one time, I slept after Asr prayer and woke up at 10 PM, missing iftar altogether."" ""The menu lacks variety compared to home, and my sehri routine is completely off track,"" explained Farhan Shahriar, a maintenance lead at a reputed multinational company, currently posted in Kushtia. ""Often, I end up having a late dinner and calling it sehri. On some occasions, I've even woken up after sehri or just before the Fajr adhan.""  ""Nothing is fixed for sehri anymore,"" said Shabab Junayed, a territory officer at British American Tobacco, currently posted in Cumilla. ""Back home, I'd have someone to wake me up, but now it's just me. Often, I'm too tired, yet I have to stay up for sehri because I can't wake up once I fall asleep. For iftar, it's usually junk food from outside, which has caused me to gain a lot of weight."" Everyone has their own version of Ramadan, built on core memories. Fahim Jawad, a territory manager at Unilever Bangladesh, currently posted in Cumilla, reflects on what he misses most, ""Since childhood, my Ramadan consists of praying Taraweeh with my father and brother, arranging plates on the table and making sherbet before iftar. Every Ramadan, we'd also distribute iftar to our building's security guards and others around us. As a family, we looked forward to these traditions, but since I moved out of Dhaka last year, I can no longer partake in them.""  ""It's very lonely and depressing,"" said Rafi. ""I only now realise how coddled we actually were growing up. My mother is no longer there to wake me up for sehri. And even when I do wake up, I am all alone in this place that I have to call home. I eat by myself, and the food doesn't provide the same comfort. There's also no one to talk to when I'm feeling down,"" he lamented. ""You start to realise that happiness is in the smallest of blessings when you no longer get to experience them. I miss my mother asking me whether the sugar is okay in the lemonade or if the salt is right in the dish she cooked specifically for my brother and I. I miss walking in the cool breeze after iftar or playing Valorant with my friends until sehri, and then pretending to sleep just before my mother would come to wake me up. I miss the familiarity and peace of Ramadan at home,"" Tanvir explained. For Farhan, the biggest challenge isn't just food but also the spiritual aspect. He said, ""Back home, I used to dedicate more time to prayers and reflection during Ramadan. Here, it's not just about balancing work; I feel like I'm not making enough of an effort to strengthen my connection with my faith."" ""My sehri routine has been impacted the most,"" said Fahim, ""Usually, I would wake up before Fajr, complete sehri, and perform the Fajr prayer before going back to sleep. But now that I live alone, having a proper meal for sehri isn't feasible. It's usually just water, dates, chocolates, and a cup of milk at best. For iftar, I usually return home from the office a few minutes before iftar, rush to the nearest store to buy whatever I can find and break my fast on the street."" Staying away from family during Ramadan has also given Abdullah a new perspective on the month, ""I take nothing for granted anymore. When I return to Dhaka on alternate weekends, I get to share iftar with my family. I keep my phone in my room during iftar whenever I'm back home in Dhaka so that I can truly be in the moment and cherish every bit of it. Ramadan now means being with my family more than anything else."" ""Staying alone has given me a lot of time to reflect on myself spiritually,"" Rafi explained. ""Being away from all the distractions has helped me explore the spiritual side of Ramadan more."" Despite the challenges, perhaps the most difficult part of Ramadan for a young professional is learning how to cope and move forward. ""Challenges like these are part of the job itself,"" Fahim said, ""We're working hundreds of kilometres away from home so that we can earn a living and provide for our families. If we keep seeing these as challenges, it'll be really hard to climb out of them. Owning them, managing them, and focusing on work so that we don't get too homesick – it's all part of the job and of life itself."" In the end, Ramadan away from home is a test of resilience for young professionals. While the absence of family, home-cooked meals, and shared traditions makes the month lonelier, it also promotes introspection and self-growth. Despite the adversity, they find ways to survive –cherishing small moments, seeking spiritual fulfilment, and soldiering on with their responsibilities. Although far from home, the spirit of Ramadan remains, reminding them of the warmth back home. Reach Ifti's spam at [email protected]

The idea for this platform stemmed from my previous AI project, ""DrikAI"" which involved the use of multiple AI models like ChatGPT variants, DeepSeek, Phi4, and O1 Mini. The success and positive feedback from DrikAI inspired me to think about how AI could make a greater societal impact.  One day, during a casual brainstorming session with my peers, the concept for SereneQuran came to life. The idea was simple – create a platform that suggests people verses from the Quran that resonate emotionally and spiritually with them, helping them find comfort and clarity in their moments of need. To bring this concept to life, I used the GPT-4o Mini model, chosen for its lightweight yet powerful capabilities. The model processes users' input by identifying their emotional tone and searching for the most relevant Quran verses from an open-source Quran JSON repository. If an exact match is not found, the model extends the search to trusted external sources. This allows SereneQuran to provide contextually appropriate and spiritually meaningful verses, tailored to the user's mood or emotional state. Accuracy and reliability are crucial components of the app, especially given the spiritual nature of its purpose. To ensure this, the interpretations and explanations of the Quran verses come from trusted and reputable Islamic sources. While the AI model is effective in finding contextually relevant verses, we also encourage users to consult scholarly interpretations for deeper insights. The app ensures transparency by allowing users to report any discrepancies, ensuring ongoing improvement. Since launching, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Within the first few days, SereneQuran surpassed a thousand users, many of whom expressed how much the app resonated with them. I envision SereneQuran becoming a daily companion for users seeking spiritual guidance. By offering emotionally relevant Quran verses and interpretations, the app can provide comfort and clarity during difficult moments, helping individuals in their personal and spiritual growth. Looking ahead, there are exciting plans for SereneQuran. Some of the features currently being considered include Hadith recommendations, an audio feature for Quran recitations, and a Zakat calculator, all based on valuable user feedback.  Raiyan Bin Sarwar is a Campus Ambassador for The Daily Star from Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP). ","Fri Mar 21, 2025 08:04 PM         Last update on: Fri Mar 21, 2025 08:09 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/pursuing-mba-2025-it-still-practical-3852221","Is an MBA still practical for 2025?","There's an ad from FedEx that follows a new employee within the company with an MBA – Master of Business Administration – degree. The employee in question is reluctant to do a shipping assignment, which his supervisor reassures is very straightforward and simple enough that it can be done by anyone. ""You don't understand, I have an MBA,"" the employee says in the ad. ""Oh, you have an MBA. In that case, I'll have to show you how to do it,"" says his supervisor in response.   While the ad was from over two decades ago, its opinion on MBA holders could not be more relevant in 2025. Historically, holding an MBA has always been the gold standard in management. An MBA would be the key to climbing the ever-so-daunting corporate ladder and accelerating career progression. But times have changed, and so has the job market as well as the value of certain degrees. In light of reports that in today's job market, even MBA candidates from elite Business schools are struggling to get jobs, increased scepticism on the programme should not come as a surprise. There used to be a time in the 2000s when only select institutes such as the Institute of Business Administration, Dhaka University (IBA-DU) and North South University (NSU) offered MBA degrees. It was assumed that MBA holders coming out of these universities were usually of exceptional calibre and went on to reap the benefits financially. However, over the past decade, there's been a boom in the number of Business schools offering MBA degrees, whether public or private, accredited or unaccredited. Consequently, there's now an surplus of MBA degree holders fiercely competing for jobs in a contractionary economy. But what drives so many graduates to spend an additional two years pursuing a degree that does not add much supplementary value to their employability in this era?  A big criticism of Management degrees in Bangladesh is the generalised scope of knowledge they provide. While many foreign programmes have customisable double MBA or MS degrees and unique pathways ranging from climate to technology management, the same can't be said for the ones offered in Bangladesh. Most MBA programmes here are rigidly bound to the typical management, finance, marketing, and operations concentrations. Additionally, some courses can be redundant for candidates with prior exposure to business studies, as new material may not be covered. ""I don't think an MBA adds to one's skills,"" says Syeda Faiza, an HR executive at a local IT company. ""As a Business student, I found that it teaches the same subject matter as undergrad courses, with a bit more depth."" As mentioned previously, MBA programmes are everywhere in universities, and their widespread availability might suggest strong industry demand. However, whether this assumption holds true remains a matter of debate. From an employer's standpoint, having an MBA is often less important than where it was obtained from. Recruiters frequently use the reputation of an institution as a proxy for a candidate's competence, making the prestige of the university a crucial factor in hiring decisions.  The degree itself, however, is often seen as a way to stay competitive in a job market where mid to senior-level professionals often hold MBA degrees. In fact, some workplaces make pursuing an MBA a formal requirement for career advancement. That being said, not everyone needs to pursue an MBA. It is arguably most beneficial for individuals from non-business backgrounds who want to acquire theoretical business acumen to advance in their careers or launch their own enterprises. For these professionals, an MBA can provide a structured foundation in business principles that they might not have encountered otherwise. However, for those with a business background, the value of an MBA is not as clear. Career advancement is not solely tied to obtaining the degree, and other pathways can often be more efficient. If someone is fresh out of their undergraduate studies, they may find that industry-specific certifications, such as the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) for finance, Six Sigma for process improvement, or Certified Supply Chain Analyst (CSCA) for supply chain management, offer more targeted and practical knowledge than a generalised MBA. A major drawback of many MBA programmes, particularly in Bangladesh, is their failure to address key knowledge gaps left by undergraduate studies. Many curricula remain outdated, struggling to keep pace with the rapidly evolving, AI-driven business world we are marching into.  Waseka Alam, an MBA graduate from a well-known private university in Dhaka, offers a candid assessment of her experience. ""MBA, in Bangladesh, is mostly book-based knowledge. In a few courses, we were required to visit factories for group projects, but often, the employees were unwilling to share details about the business. I completed both my BBA – Bachelor of Business Administration – and MBA and to be honest, I didn't learn anything new. I already knew most of the material from my undergraduate degree, and even from my O and A level Business Studies. However, for students from non-business backgrounds, who want to start a business or enter the corporate world, an MBA can provide valuable foundational knowledge. For those who have been studying Business throughout high school, college, and university, I don't think it adds much unless it's a strict requirement for their job."" This highlights a critical issue – the lack of practical learning. An MBA programme should train students for real-world business challenges, equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate complex management environments. If a programme fails to do so, it raises serious concerns about the return on investment. Theoretical knowledge alone is not enough; without industry engagement, working on case studies that reflect current challenges, and exposure to emerging business trends, an MBA can feel like a redundant extension of undergraduate education. Nonetheless, an MBA is not entirely pointless. While it may not be the most efficient way to gain specialised skills, it can offer valuable networking opportunities. Business schools provide access to a professional network that can open doors to career opportunities that might otherwise be difficult to reach. ""Thanks to a couple of years of experience working in HR alongside pursuing my MBA, I can see myself getting promotions more easily or moving to another company in a better position with better pay,"" explains Faiza. Of course, while an MBA might offer an initial career boost, long-term success still depends on continuous learning, adaptability, and staying relevant in a dynamic business world. Also, an MBA degree might not be the career-fixing band-aid it used to be in the past, but it could still help you get your foot through the door in certain job spheres, especially in lucrative industries such as banking, finance, consulting, and technology. Furthermore, having an MBA degree will allow candidates to be taken more seriously at work, something Faiza shares from her experience saying, ""With the stamp of an MBA degree, you get to assert yourself into leadership positions more easily."" Having said all that, is an MBA still practical in 2025? That depends entirely on your goals, the industries you plan to work in, and the specific career-centric value that an MBA programme can provide. For some, the investment will pay off while for others, alternative learning paths may prove far more rewarding.","Thu Mar 20, 2025 10:00 AM         Last update on: Thu Mar 20, 2025 06:55 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/mayhem-lady-gagas-new-album-delightfully-chaotic-mix-old-and-new-3852451","MAYHEM: Lady Gaga’s new album is a delightfully chaotic mix of old and new","As a kid who grew up dreaming of wearing a meat dress and danced to ""Born This Way"" every day in the shower, my disappointment with Chromatica was unimaginable. Restrained, sensitised, and carrying a distinct sense of being ""manufactured"", it just felt like a mish-mash of tracks thrown together cosplaying a quintessential Gaga album. The five-year wait, marked by a jazz project and two failed soundtrack albums, after that disastrous release felt excruciatingly long. However, when I opened Spotify on March 7 and was greeted by MAYHEM, a brand-new Lady Gaga album — whose first track, ""Disease"", sounded like a grungy, gothic callback to ""Born This Way"" and The Fame Monster — I was instantly hooked.   Following the slow and heavy opening, the second track, ""Abracadabra"", is what many describe as classic Lady Gaga. Its psychedelic dance-pop sound and energetic choreography — reminiscent of the ""Bad Romance"" music video — is the wave of nostalgia that numerous fans, old and young, have been craving for. MAYHEM, however, is not just Gaga recalling her own glory days. Inspiration from a variety of sources is evident throughout the course of the album. ""Killah"" carries a distinct David Bowie sound. ""Shadow of a Man"" and ""Kill for Love"" (bonus track) also sound like songs straight out of Michael Jackson's discography. Strings of Madonna and Prince can be felt in places too.  A strong suit of MAYHEM is in its choruses, as seen in ""Garden of Eden"". The sultry track, referencing the Book of Genesis, is characterised by brash and energetic vocals in its verses followed by soft vocals in its chorus, almost like it is luring the listeners into temptation. The album presents a variety of sounds, ranging from heavy metal to vapourwave. Tracks such as ""Perfect Celebrity"" and ""Can't Stop the High"" (bonus track) might compel one want to scream the lyrics out loud while ""Don't Call Tonight"" and ""LoveDrug"" are songs one might blast on a lonely evening drive. ""Zombieboy"" and ""The Beast"" were probably the most fun tracks in the album. Hedonistic and unhinged in all the right ways, they preached a complete lack of inhibition in much the same way Charli XCX's Brat promised to do, only with psychedelic and grungy bits and pieces strewn about. While the first three-quarters of the album had absolutely enraptured me, the last few tracks left me somewhat disappointed. The Taylor Swift-esque sound of ""How Bad Do U Want Me"" felt disconcertingly odd in her voice. ""Blade of Grass"", a romantic nod to her fiance, employed a rather common pop melody that stripped it of all its Gaganess. ""Vanish into You"" utilised the same themes while preserving the core sound. And arguably the biggest song of the project, ""Die with a Smile"", a collaboration with Bruno Mars, felt entirely out of place. The generic ballad did not connect with the previous tracks, nor did it fit the overall daring, dance-oriented theme of the album.   However, despite a few duds, MAYHEM might just be Lady Gaga reclaiming her place as a queen of pop. She manages to pay homage to her old self and bring back the sound that enraptured so many Little Monsters while showcasing the maturity she has gained as a songwriter and musician over the past decade and a half. A raw polylith of emotions — yearning, anger, joy, ecstasy — punctuated by screaming, growling, and the occasional ballad, MAYHEM not only stands true to its name but also to the brand of Gaga. The authors can't wait to dress up in meat dresses for Halloween. ","Wed Mar 19, 2025 07:44 PM         Last update on: Wed Mar 19, 2025 07:56 PM"

He added that the freeze will help the university preserve its financial flexibility till it understands how changes in federal policy will take shape. There's a further possibility of research funding cuts, with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) at Harvard notifying faculty and staff that effective immediately, all graduate students on the waitlist for admission next fall would be denied admission. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
 On March 4, 2025, Sally Kornbluth, President of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced that the university is instituting ""a hiring freeze on all staff positions that are not required for safety, compliance or other critical needs."" Additionally, in the plans for its central budget for the next year, MIT is making 5-10 percent cuts for their academic and administrative units.   University of Pennsylvania In late February, University of Pennsylvania notified department chairs that it would reduce graduate programme admissions rates by about one third. Consequently, many of the graduate offers that were approved by the departments are being rescinded.  Additionally, on March 10, the university announced a hiring freeze and a pause on adjustments to staff salary for this fiscal year.  University of Washington University of Washington (UW) faces the double uncertainty of federal funding cuts and state budget shortfalls. On March 7, 2025, in a message addressed to university leadership, Ana Mari Cauce, President, and Tricia R Serio, Provost and Executive Vice President, announced a range of cost-cutting measures including a pause on all non-essential, in-progress staff recruitments as well as new hiring requests, limitations on faculty and academic personnel recruitments, and a constraint on all non-core activities that do not directly support instruction, research, and public service missions, including programmes launched with one-time funding. Columbia University Earlier in March, the Trump administration cut USD 400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University. Four government agencies announced in a statement ""the immediate cancellation of approximately $400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University due to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students."" Johns Hopkins University
 On March 14, 2025, Johns Hopkins University announced that it will eliminate more than 2,000 jobs — 1,975 internationally and 247 in the US. Due to a loss of USD 800 million in grants from USAID, the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health announced these eliminations. This will affect programmes working on diarrheal disease in Bangladesh, HIV prevention in India and Africa, research on elimination of tuberculosis, malaria prevention in Tanzania, and support for pregnant mothers in Nigeria and Afghanistan.  University of Pittsburgh Recently, University of Pittsburgh announced a faculty and staff hiring freeze that will remain in place through the end of the current fiscal year and may be extended into the next. Previously, in February, the university announced that it would pause additional PhD admissions.  University of Notre Dame University of Notre Dame President Fr Robert Dowd, Provost John McGreevy, and Executive Vice President Shannon Cullinan sent an email to faculty members informing them of a freeze on all staff hiring as well as limitations on indirect spending. It also directed all departments to model a plan for a 5 percent budget reduction should that become necessary.  Iowa State University According to a spokesperson for Iowa State University, the university is reviewing offers for graduate student admissions and apprenticeships, and some departments are rescinding offers made to some graduate students who have not yet accepted their offer of admission. There also remain uncertainties about funding for graduate research at Iowa State.  Brown University On March 13, 2025, Provost Francis J Doyle III and Executive Vice President Sarah Latham announced that Brown University will be taking measures to reduce spending. These will include a mandatory salary freeze for members of the President's Cabinet and a voluntary freeze for other highly compensated administrators, a temporary staff hiring freeze effective immediately, and freezing of all non-essential travel.  References: ","Mon Mar 17, 2025 08:04 PM         Last update on: Mon Mar 17, 2025 08:30 PM"

Garber wrote that the freeze was the ""most drastic step"" Harvard is taking in response to new White House orders. He added that the freeze will help the university preserve its financial flexibility till it understands how changes in federal policy will take shape. In his message, Garber said, ""It is imperative to limit significant new long-term commitments that would increase our financial exposure and make further adjustments more disruptive."" The freeze will go into effect immediately across all of Harvard's schools. However, as per Garber's email, the freeze is meant to be temporary. Garber also mentioned that he would work with administrators to figure out ways to tighten their spending. He further asked leaders of various schools and administrative units within Harvard to scrutinise ""discretionary and non-salary spending"" and conduct a rigorous review of any new multi-year commitments.  Also, there's a further possibility of research funding cuts, meaning PhD students, in particular, might have to suffer the consequences of the freeze. Already, on March 11, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) at Harvard notified FAS faculty and staff that effective immediately, all graduate students on the waitlist for admission next fall would be denied admission. Harvard is the latest university to hit pause on hiring as the Trump administration puts millions of dollars of federal funding in limbo. Aside from Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University, Cornell University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) also announced hiring freezes, citing possible research funding cuts. Earlier in the month, the Trump administration cut USD 400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University for failing to address antisemitism on its campus.  ","Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:16 PM         Last update on: Sun Mar 16, 2025 04:23 PM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/career/news/career-technical-writing-what-you-should-know-3848546","A career in technical writing: What you should know","Any software or technical product requires an accessible and understandable guide for its users, be it tutorials detailing the step-by-step process to use that product or documentation explaining its features and functions. This is where technical writers come in. While often confused or interchanged with content writing, technical writing serves a distinctly different purpose. Technical writing is the process of transforming complex technical information into accessible content for target audiences or users. It involves creating manuals, user guides, documentation, and other instructional or informational materials, such as updating changelogs that help users understand software, hardware, and other technical products. Technical writers may also have to write UI (user interface) texts and product descriptions for the company's website. Content writers, on the other hand, usually have to write blogs, social media posts, and other marketing materials on a variety of topics. As the name suggests, technical writing is a bit more 'technical' and precise in every sense, whereas content writing requires more creativity. Technical writing is one of the most important and growing fields in tech companies worldwide. While developers work on building the software, technical writers are needed to make that software understandable for users. Thus, to be a technical writer, you need to have good writing and analytical skills. Depending on the type of company you're working for, you may require some knowledge of programming and software development, but in most cases, this is not mandatory. Usually, technical writers are taught the basics of the company's software and how to use it. For instance, if the company works on web development based on a particular content management system (CMS), the technical writer will be kept up-to-speed on how to use that CMS before they are tasked with work. Furthermore, technical writers are required to do some additional tasks beyond writing. A key part of technical writing is constantly collaborating with developers, product managers, UI/UX designers, and other team members to gather information and ensure the documentation is consistent and up-to-date. A technical writer needs to properly understand how the features of a product work and think of ways to easily explain that to potential users. This requires thorough research of the product and similar products on the market as well as frequent collaboration with the dev and design teams.  Due to how closely technical writing is linked with software development, it is a good alternative for Computer Science or Computer Science and Engineering majors who want to work in the field but are not necessarily interested in jobs that require coding or a lot of technical skills. However, one does not need to have studied Computer Science to be a technical writer; anyone from any background can enter this field so long as they are good at writing and research. Companies mainly observe an applicant's writing portfolio and aptitude when hiring technical writers. In Bangladesh, technical writing is an expanding field. One of the main reasons why this field is used interchangeably with content writing is because companies in the country tend to combine these roles within their teams. Often, content writers and people in marketing roles are tasked with technical writing responsibilities. Companies tend to name their roles: ""content analyst"", ""research associate"", or simply ""content writer"". To understand which role requires technical writing, you need to check the job responsibilities and requirements listed by the company before applying. It is worth noting that due to the hybrid nature of these roles, being a technical writer in Bangladesh means you may also have to do marketing and content-oriented work, such as creating and editing video tutorials, writing blogs, and writing and managing the company's social media posts. While it does forego the specialised nature of technical writing, the bright side of this kind of work means you gain more versatility in your career trajectory and can pivot to marketing and content management roles later on. Technical writing is a great way for people who are talented in writing and have great analytical skills to find work in software companies, IT firms, and start-ups. As long as you know how to write user-centric content, are able to research and understand technical products well, and can learn additional yet related skills such as video editing when needed, then technical writing may be the right career path for you. While most companies in Bangladesh might not treat technical writing as its own specialisation, the work itself is still an important part of the tech industry and the hybrid roles they offer can allow you to use technical writing as a stepping stone to other fields.","Sat Mar 15, 2025 02:22 PM         Last update on: Sat Mar 15, 2025 02:28 PM"

I'd like to thank the Ministry for giving letdowns like us another opportunity to make our parents proud."" The Ministry of Public Administration recently increased the age limit for BCS exams to 32 years, thus encouraging an even older group of people to use their brain cells for memorising irrelevant information.

""My family members and relatives from all around the country came to counsel me and talk some sense into me,"" continued Shadman, ""My father disowned me because he was too ashamed to tell people that his son wasn't preparing for BCS.

Shadman's father was willing to accept his son back after he completed his PhD and enrolled in a BCS coaching centre. ""During his university entrance exams, I pushed him to get into the best engineering university in the country,"" said Shadman's father, ""But never in my wildest nightmares had I imagined that my own son would want to do something as shameless as pursuing a career in his university major! My family has had graduates from medical colleges and engineering universities. Even the unambitious and clueless ones made it to BBA. But no one dared pursue further studies in their majors. In our family, BCS is like the gutter where dreams from all branches of education come to suffocate and die."" Mr Baharul Pasha, the branch manager of the Roshunbhora Branch of BCS Purists, explained how increasing the age limit for BCS is an effective way of implementing reverse brain drain.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/ramadan-away-home-3845966","Ramadan away from home ","As a freshman, the realisation that I was going to have to spend the very first day of Ramadan at my university dormitory was nothing short of crushing. Between phone calls from home telling me that my absence was deeply felt and not having the chance to busy myself with iftar preparations – the entire ordeal weighed heavy. In retrospect, the iftar items that my hostel provided were quite delicious, but my homesickness hindered my ability to enjoy them. Despite an apprehensive beginning, I'd spent another two Ramadans at my university. I am currently spending another. Homesickness has always been associated with Ramadans spent at dorms. Even though I am able to return home on the weekends, this is a privilege many students, including my peers who aren't residents of Dhaka, cannot afford until classes have wrapped up. The difficulties of spending Ramadan aren't simply limited to homesickness. There are a bunch of challenges students must navigate as they balance their studies with worship and fasting. Rigid schedules for classes and exams don't exactly help the situation. In the month of abstinence and devotion, it's quite important for dormitories to ensure an environment conducive to religious practices. According to Rabiul Hasan, a student at Dhaka University (DU) and a resident of Sir AF Rahman Hall, the hostel environment falls short in this regard. He shares, ""I've generally had a good experience spending Ramadan in dorms. However, there were some challenges, such as having sehri very early due to fixed schedules.  It felt as though I couldn't fully absorb the spiritual aspects due to the dorm environment."" ""The communal atmosphere and shared experience can be motivating, but rigid schedules and limited facilities can often be disruptive. At home, I have more flexibility, which can help in terms of both studying and worship. It's also difficult to find quiet spaces for prayer and reflection. I feel that my experience can be improved if the dorm residents were more mindful about the noise level and considerate regarding schedules,"" he adds. While the menu varies from household to household, some items such as dates, jilapi, beguni, piyaju, etc., are commonplace. Moreover, dorms around the country generally serve these items. While the health repercussions of having fried items during iftar can be debated, the main concern for students is the quality of the food itself. Not to mention, not all dorms are able to serve all their residents, which forces some students to resort to local hotels and restaurants. There's also the matter of other meals like sehri, as well as breakfast and lunch – for those who don't or are unable to fast – that often goes unaddressed. Humayra Adiba, a student at Chittagong Medical College, shares that her dormitory has been able to facilitate quality food for students. ""My experience spending Ramadan at the dorms was far better than I expected, although it was a little sad without my family. All my roommates and I had iftar together, and good food was available close to our dorms. My dorm provides regular iftar items like beguni, piyaju, chola, and alur chop, which are quite good. We are served rice and curries for sehri, but the quality is not satisfactory. The dormitory doesn't generally make enough for everyone, as some students buy food from outside or cook in their own dorm rooms. The dorm canteen doesn't provide breakfast and lunch for those not fasting either,"" she remarks. She adds that despite having access to tools, it's not always feasible for students to cook for themselves. ""We have classes and a lot of academic pressure to deal with so we're always rushing to have sehri and iftar. We also don't have enough time to cook proper food. I believe the dormitory should seek to ensure the quality of food is high as well as make sure there's enough for all its residents,"" she explains. Not all dormitories are able to live up to this standard, however. Ahnaf Tahmid, a student of Rajshahi Medical College, shares that he's had some concerns about the food quality, ""The quality of food in my dorm drops from time to time and we can't ever be too sure about the hygiene standards of restaurants and hostels either. We also don't always have the appetite to eat dorm food. On the flip side, we're often too tired to cook for ourselves. While we can't expect dorm food to go toe-to-toe with homemade meals, healthy food is the primary concern. I wouldn't want to fall sick during such a crucial time because of stale or old food. As long as that is ensured, most of us would be quite happy."" Overwhelming academic stress is another common issue that students must account for. Even though classes are marginally shortened during this month, regular academic activities cannot be condensed for multiple reasons. Ahnaf Tahmid talks about the stress he's had to withstand as a fifth-year medical student: ""Spending the majority of Ramadan in dorms is a norm as the classes keep going for at least 25 days. The healthcare field is demanding, especially in a divisional, state-owned hospital. We have classes from morning till noon and have to attend wards and clinical classes. Even though it's quite tough and borderline uncomfortable at times, I'd advocate for staying at the dorms for productivity."" Most dorms don't enforce a schedule, but academic course load basically forces students to adhere to a routine. Safwan Sami, a student at the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), shares the various reasons why he's gotten accustomed to following a certain schedule during Ramadan. ""In IUT, our schedules are mostly packed with exams as well as classes. Not to mention, if you don't show up on time, you might not get food during sehri. Cooking facilities are also very limited, and cannot accommodate all the residential students. But dorm life in IUT is comfortable, and spending time with friends is fun. I've found that following a strict schedule due to classes helps me be more productive. The surroundings also help me feel closer to my faith."" Ramadan is a religious and spiritual experience. Spending it together can bring people closer. The common consensus among residential students is that once they get over homesickness, the experience is usually quite pleasant. In fact, the difficulties only make their resolutions stronger. Most importantly, even if a student is struggling, the light at the end of the tunnel –an Eid with loved ones – awaits.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/where-do-medical-assistants-fit-our-health-system-3846141","Where do medical assistants fit into our health system?","Healthcare is a collaborative exercise. Healthcare professionals of different levels and qualifications work under the same system to provide patients with optimised healthcare. However, a lack of clear demarcation within the infrastructure and the transgression of existing boundaries by medical assistants, in particular, have led to controversy and widespread protests across the country. There are currently 16 government-run Medical Assistant Training Schools with over 200 non-government MATS-related institutes. These schools offer a Diploma in Medicine Faculty (DMF) course of three years with a year's internship. The qualification required to get into one of these schools is a minimum 2.5 GPA in SSC or equivalent exams. According to the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC) Act of 2010, the BMDC recognises MATS as 'medical assistants'. It also has strict guidelines for the 73 drugs they can administer and the minimal external surgeries they can perform (under the supervision of a qualified doctor, of course).  Following these guidelines, they can apply to work as Sub Assistant Community Medical Officers (SACMO) under the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) at different NGOs, or practice privately in remote areas. Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) or Local Medical Assistant and Family Planning (LMAFP) are entirely separate courses, requiring 3 to 8 months to complete. These degrees, producing ""village doctors"", are less regulated. Moreover, applicants can range from SSC graduates to postgraduates in any subject. This degree is, however, not recognised by the BMDC.  In August 2024, the BMDC ruled that Diploma Medical Practitioners can use the title ""Dr"" before their names. The use of ""Dr"" has given rise to widespread condemnation from the MBBS community, claiming that the rural populace often cannot differentiate between an MBBS doctor and a DMF doctor. They see the prefix ""Dr"" and immediately feel a sense of security. Many DMF doctors, capitalising on this trust, do not adhere to the 73-drug list published by the BMDC and perform complex surgeries or even cesarean sections without supervision. Moreover, medical assistants prescribing ultrasonography of the uterus in male patients and antibiotics for more than three months have sparked widespread outrage on social media. There is no international precedent for paramedics or medical assistant equivalents to use ""Dr"". But MATS students continue to demand that they should be allowed to practice as diploma doctors because they've gone through four years of schooling. Nonetheless, years of neglect in the formalisation of the MATS curriculum and a lack of oversight in the quality of these schools have led to instances like the ones stated above.   Doctors are often seen as the backbone of the healthcare system. However, the system relies on a range of professionals to function effectively. MATS graduates, as their name suggests, are trained to assist medical practitioners, and their skills fill critical gaps in Bangladesh's healthcare infrastructure, particularly in emergency and rural care. Globally, paramedics play a pivotal role in emergency response which significantly improves patient outcomes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), countries with robust paramedic systems have seen a reduction in preventable deaths caused by delays in emergency care. Bangladesh, however, lacks a standardised paramedic workforce. With proper training and regulatory frameworks, MATS graduates can become skilled paramedics, addressing both healthcare needs and unemployment among this group. For instance, India's introduction of paramedic training programmes under the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) has demonstrated how such initiatives can enhance healthcare delivery while creating employment opportunities. Furthermore, integrating MATS graduates into the healthcare system aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 3, which stresses universal health coverage and access to quality care. By leveraging their potential, Bangladesh can take a significant step towards building a more resilient and inclusive healthcare system. The protests, therefore, are a wake-up call for systemic reform that benefits both healthcare professionals and the population at large.  The dilemma of using ""Dr""
 On March 12, 2025, the High Court directed that only individuals who have completed their MBBS and BDS degrees can use the title ""Dr"". The court also clarified that those who previously used the title despite not completing MBBS or BDS degrees cannot be punished. However, any such use from the day that the verdict was ruled would be considered an offence under the relevant law. The dilemma, however, over MATS graduates using the title ""Dr"" underscores a deeper struggle for recognition within the rigid professional hierarchy. While their demand reflects a desire for respect and validation, it also risks conflating their role with that of fully qualified doctors, potentially leading to confusion and ethical concerns. The title ""Dr"" is not merely an honorific; it signifies years of rigorous medical training and expertise, which MATS graduates, despite their valuable contributions, have not undergone. Allowing them to adopt this title could inadvertently dilute its significance and undermine public trust in healthcare credentials. This issue is further complicated by the fact that even village doctors use the title ""Dr"" in some cases, despite receiving less standardised training than MATS graduates. Their use of the title has similarly sparked debates about professionalism and the integrity of medical credentials. This dual dilemma really accentuates a systemic issue: the lack of clear titles and career pathways for paramedical professionals in Bangladesh.  Instead of focusing solely on the title, the solution should lie in creating formalised roles and titles that reflect their expertise, such as ""Paramedic Officer"" or ""Medical Assistant Specialist"" for MATS graduates, and ""Community Health Officer"" for SACMOs. This approach would grant them the respect they deserve while maintaining the integrity of professional distinctions. Countries with advanced healthcare systems have successfully integrated paramedics into their frameworks, recognising their indispensable role in emergency and rural care without conflating their qualifications with those of doctors.   Ultimately, the fight for recognition should not be about a title but about creating a system that values their contributions and provides clear career pathways. Respect is earned not through prefixes but through the quality of service and the impact of one's work. What matters most is the value they bring to healthcare, not the letters before their name.  Mehrab Jamee is an activist at Sandhani and a fifth-year medical student at Mugda Medical College.

The protestors started from their campuses and marched through the streets of the Bashundhara Residential Area with posters and banners saying, ""We want justice!"" and ""The liability is only yours. You are the rapist"" while chanting in solidarity, ""Inform the entire Bengal! Bury the rapist!"" Dr Razia Sultana Khan, advisor to the Department of English and Modern Languages at IUB, said during the rally, ""We cannot keep quiet. Silence means we are allowing it to happen. We are allowing the destruction of the most vulnerable of people. We are supposed to be their fathers and mothers, and what are we doing? We are raping our children. What has happened to humanity?"" Dr Khan added, ""We have to get up. We have to unite in solidarity. This is not just a woman's cause. This is a degeneration of our whole nation. We have lost all our morals. What is this society, if we cannot protect our most vulnerable, our children?"" Sharmee Hossain, a senior lecturer in the Department of English and Modern Languages at NSU, led the protest. When asked about her motivations for organising the protest, she said, ""All women are paranoid, from children to elderly, as well as women from all professional backgrounds. This is not normal. It's not just outside. A woman is not safe anywhere, whether online or even in their own homes. It seems to me as if a war has been declared against women. The interim government must remember that the country would have seen no change without the women during the July Uprising.""  Hossain further adds, ""The government must ensure the safety of the female citizens of its country. This isn't the Bangladesh the general people stood for a few months ago. We must allow our girls to stand tall with their heads held high. This is our country, and we are not leaving this place. We demand justice and safety. If the government cannot ensure that, they should resign. We will not stop until our demands are met."" Reflecting on her teacher's sentiments, Nafsin Mehanaz Azireen, a current student of NSU and one of the frontliners during the July Uprising, states, ""Bangladesh has seen a rise in rape cases, more so after the people's revolt of 2024. When I learned about the rally to be held outside our campus today, I called upon my fellow university mates and friends from IUB. We took to the streets together, with our teachers from NSU and IUB.""  Tahsim Uzzaman, a current student at IUB and also a frontliner during the July Uprising, notes, ""The way rape cases have increased in our country, and how they have not even spared children is what enrages me. Among my female friends, if I were to pick out four, three out of them share the common story of being harassed by a relative but not being able to speak up about it. The way such cases are kept hidden under the facade of shame is what our protest is about."" According to the students and teachers of NSU and IUB, the protests will continue until justice is served and the safety of all women on the streets and in their homes is ensured. From this rally, they demand justice for the organised violent attacks of the past five months.  ","Mon Mar 10, 2025 01:14 AM         Last update on: Mon Mar 10, 2025 10:02 AM"
"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/the-necessity-having-mindful-conversations-parents-3842416","The necessity of having mindful conversations with parents","Growing up in a household of nine, I often felt like my voice got lost in the daily chaos. My mother was always caught up in an endless cycle of chores, and my father, away for work, would return home too drained to engage in conversation. Eventually, I stopped trying. There were times I wished my parents would ask how school was, celebrate my small victories, or simply check in on how I was feeling. But their attention was always pulled elsewhere. Over the years, that silence became second nature. Now, even when I want to express myself, I hesitate, unsure of whether my words would truly reach them. I soon realised that this wasn't something I experienced alone. My friends, cousins, and even acquaintances shared similar stories, narratives of feeling unheard, of conversations cut short, or of the fear that their words would be dismissed. It became clear that the gap in communication between parents and children is not just a personal struggle but a widespread issue. Despite living under the same roof, many of us grow up feeling emotionally distant from our parents, unsure of how to bridge the divide. Now that many of us stay away from our parents for university or work, the communication seems to be harder. Trina Talukdar, a student of Leading University in Sylhet, shares her relationship with her parents. ""As the years passed, I found myself becoming more reserved. I started holding back, unsure of how to communicate certain emotions or problems. It's not that my parents became less approachable, but somewhere along the way, I developed a hesitation either out of fear of judgment and misunderstanding or simply the feeling that they might not fully grasp what I was going through."" The rarity of situations where both parents and children actively listen to each other forms the very foundation of the hesitation that exists between them. In many households, conversations are often one-sided — either dominated by parental authority or limited to surface-level exchanges. As a result, children grow up feeling unheard, while parents remain unaware of the emotional distance that gradually forms. ""One of the biggest issues is that young people feel neglected when meaningful communication is missing. The way parents interact with their children, both in terms of tone and engagement, has a lasting impact,"" says Mostak Ahamed Imran, a play therapist and educational psychologist. He adds, ""In the first five years of a child's development, they need to be treated as individuals with emotions and thoughts of their own. Empathy plays a crucial role during this stage, as children are highly perceptive. They can easily sense coldness in a parent's tone or lack of engagement, which may lead them to feel unheard or unimportant. If this pattern continues, it can shape how they express themselves in the future, making open conversations more difficult as they grow older.""  As a result of this lack of open and vulnerable conversations with their parents, many teenagers and young adults struggle to navigate relationships outside their family as well. When meaningful dialogue and emotional expression are not encouraged at home, children grow up without the necessary experience to communicate their thoughts and feelings effectively. This not only affects their ability to form deep connections but also shapes the way they approach relationships, leading to the development of different attachment styles. Aman Shahbaz, a student of Chhatak Govt. College, shares his struggle with expressing emotions, saying, ""I am willing to talk to people about my feelings, but I don't know how to. So, I end up not saying anything at all."" This sentiment speaks to the experience of many young individuals who, despite wanting to open up, find themselves unable to articulate their thoughts and emotions. The absence of early practice in meaningful conversations leads to hesitation and self-doubt, making it difficult to engage in honest discussions, even with close friends and family. Over time, this silence can create emotional barriers, reinforcing the cycle of isolation and unexpressed feelings. To avoid the emotional exhaustion of unsurfaced emotions, it is necessary to create a space in each home where all members' opinions and say is equally heard and valued. Mostak Ahamed emphasises the importance of compassion in family interactions. He advises making mindful conversations, where each member of the family listens to others talk about their experiences without judgement, a daily practice that is free from distractions and built on genuine attentiveness. ""Being actively listened to boosts self-confidence. When individuals feel that their thoughts and emotions are valued, they develop a stronger sense of self-worth, making them more comfortable expressing themselves in different social settings. This, in turn, contributes to a more positive worldview, as they grow up believing that their opinions matter and that meaningful connections are built on mutual understanding,"" says Imran. Tanbhir Ahmed Mahin, a student of North South University, shares his positive experiences in this regard. ""Living alone can sometimes feel isolating, but having my parents to talk to makes a huge difference. They provide a sense of comfort and security that no one else can. Whether I'm struggling with personal issues, career decisions, or just everyday stress, opening up to them helps ease my worries. They don't judge me; instead, they listen, guide, and remind me of my strength."" He adds, ""When I started to converse with my parents, it went better than I expected. I was hesitant but sometimes it only takes a little effort from both sides. Parents often understand more than we give them credit for."" At its core, having mindful conversations is about fostering a culture of mutual understanding and emotional depth. Whether it's a simple inquiry about one's day or a profound discussion on life's challenges, these moments of genuine connection strengthen relationships and contribute to the emotional well-being of all involved. Open and intentional communication nurtures trust, deepens empathy, and transforms familial bonds into sources of unwavering support. It is never too late to initiate these conversations because sometimes, all it takes is a single step to realise that understanding and connection have been within reach all along.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/star-youth/news/keeping-your-vaccines-3842406","Keeping up with your vaccines","A world where polio, measles, and tuberculosis, once life-threatening illnesses, are just a distant memory is as near as it has ever been, thanks to vaccines. Vaccines are one of the greatest feats of modern medicine, preventing millions from disease, death, and devastation so that we, as humans, can lead a healthier lifestyles. They work by basically ""training"" the immune system to recognise and eliminate dangerous pathogens, often even before we have been in contact with the pathogens. In Bangladesh, too, people are protected throughout their lives, from infancy to adulthood, by a well-organised and structured immunisation programme, protecting communities from outbreaks of fatal diseases.  Dr ASM Mahamuduzzanan, Assistant Professor of the Department of Pediatrics at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, states, ""Now, vaccination coverage is so huge in Bangladesh that hardly anyone is at risk of vaccine preventable illnesses. Most kids are vaccinated now, very few are not and there should be even fewer. The vaccination rate in Bangladesh is very high now."" Widespread vaccination has virtually eliminated these diseases, and vaccine-preventable diseases rarely cause severe illness compared to years past. Vaccines are effective for a lifetime, starting from birth. The BCG vaccine against tuberculosis and the first dose of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) are administered to all newborns under the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI). These are important interventions that foster long-term immunity. The pentavalent vaccine, which confers immunity against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B, is administered at six weeks. There is a pneumonia vaccine called the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) whose follow-ups are given at 10 and 14 weeks, primarily to enhance immunity.  The immune system of children, while growing up, needs to be strengthened. The measles and rubella (MR) vaccine at nine months provides critical protection against these highly infectious diseases. A second dose of the measles vaccine at 15 months reinforces even greater and longer-lasting protection. Vaccines like DPT and Td provide 100 percent protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis whooping cough, with their booster shots given between one and five years.  Although our vaccination rates are high, vaccine preventable diseases do not disappear completely. While serious diseases are rare, Dr Mahamuduzzanan says, ""The absence of vaccination results in hepatitis A, smallpox, typhoid, cholera, and rotaviral diarrhea. Those who have not kept up with their required immunisations are also at risk of hepatitis B, tetanus, and mumps."" This underlines the need for full immunisation and awareness programmes.  The HPV vaccine, offered to teenage girls by the government, is a potential game changer. This is a paradigm shift in the prevention of cervical cancer, soon to be available in Bangladesh, where cervical cancer is the second most common cancer and a leading cause of death in women. This one-time vaccine leads to thousands of lives being saved by preventing cancers associated with human papillomavirus before we pass through the prime years of infection between the ages of 10 and 14. Older females should especially be encouraged to receive medical consultation for the HPV vaccine's alternative options.  Extra protection is necessary for women of childbearing age, especially when they are pregnant. The TT vaccine protects infants against potentially fatal neonatal tetanus and is given in five doses, often at wide intervals. The seasonal influenza vaccine should also be given to pregnant women to prevent flu-related complications that are particularly dangerous during pregnancy. But when people become adults, they still need vaccines to prevent disease. Older adults and people with chronic diseases are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza and, therefore, as we said, each year they are strongly advised to receive a yearly flu vaccine. Depending on individual risk factors, travel, and occupation, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A, meningococcal disease, and rabies vaccines are also recommended. Extra shots are given at very specific locations to help protect more carefully where the infection is most likely to spread. But vaccination is not just a matter of protecting oneself, it is a community effort.  Herd immunity is the result of a reduction in the spread of contagious disease when enough of a population is immune to the disease through vaccination. This is particularly important for individuals who are unable to get vaccinated due to medical conditions, so immunisation is everyone's responsibility.  The near elimination of some diseases is an indication of how effective vaccination is, according to Dr Mahamuduzzanan. ""With timely vaccination, polio and smallpox are already essentially eliminated. The incidence of diphtheria, measles, and tuberculosis with severe symptoms has declined,"" he points out. These success stories show how immunisation has great short-term and long-term effects on public health.  Although lifesaving, vaccines have traditionally been greeted with scepticism due to misinformation. Misconceptions and myths can fuel vaccine hesitancy, putting individuals and communities at risk unnecessarily. It is important to be trusting of science and consult with healthcare professionals for accurate information about vaccines.  Maintaining up-to-date vaccinations is vital for long-term immunity and preventing disease resurgence. While Bangladesh has high vaccination rates, gaps remain, particularly in influenza and hepatitis B coverage. A study found that only 66.6 percent of healthcare workers had received the hepatitis B vaccine, with coverage as low as 38.8 percent among cleaning staff, despite over a quarter experiencing needlestick injuries. Influenza vaccination rates are also low, even though 86.2 percent of healthcare workers expressed their willingness to get vaccinated. The COVID-19 pandemic made us realise the importance of vaccination, with Bangladesh's coverage rising from less than 4 percent in mid-2021 to over 68 percent by mid-2022, yet sustaining immunity requires adherence to booster schedules and tackling vaccine hesitancy. To ensure long-term immunity and prevent disease resurgence, continuous efforts are necessary to close these gaps, particularly among healthcare workers. A dividend from immunisation is a future free from the diseases that rob communities of health and well-being, a future free of these unwanted ailments. One cannot overlook the wonders vaccines can do. So, embrace them, trust them, and let them help you in protecting yourself and your loved ones. Purna is a third-year student at Shaheed M.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/life-after-cadet-college-adjusting-aspirations-and-adapting-changes-3840391","Life after cadet college: Adjusting aspirations and adapting to changes","What's the first thing that comes to mind when you meet an ex-cadet? Do you assume that they're boring or maybe a little rude? Or perhaps someone who is athletic and has a solid grasp on most things? These impressions are often shaped by limited interactions, which culminate to form stereotypes. But how accurate are they? More importantly, how does it impact the students who are being judged? Md Mahmudul Hasan Sumon, a final-year undergraduate student of Printing and Publication Studies at Dhaka University (DU) and ex-cadet from Rangpur Cadet College, shares, ""Both my classmate and I needed a lot of time to break the ice. Even now, in my final year, I don't have many friends outside my cadet college circle. I try to maintain balanced connections in class, but some classmates have told me that they initially found it difficult to communicate with me."" This sentiment resonates with many ex-cadets who struggle to adjust after leaving the regimented environment of cadet college and transitioning to other institutions. A cadet begins their journey in class seven, spending six formative years immersed in a structured lifestyle. For most, these years are among the best of their lives, marked by deep friendships, camaraderie, and a strong sense of belonging. Md Moinul Islam, a student at the Institute of Business Administration, Dhaka University (IBA, DU) and ex-cadet from Mirzapur Cadet College, recalls, ""It felt like diving into a new world, though the routine was challenging. We had little to worry about in a broader sense. Our schedules were predetermined, and we knew the consequences of our actions. But the world outside is different."" While Moinul struggled with the uncertainty of change, others, like Nawshin Islam Bonna a student at the Institute of Education and Research, DU, and an ex-cadet of Joypurhat Girls' Cadet College, faced mental health challenges. ""Leaving cadet life was one of the saddest phases of my life. The mornings and evenings were never the same again. How could I spend a day without the faces I had been with for six years? It significantly impacted my mental health, especially due to the pressure of admission tests looming. Thankfully, my parents supported me through this difficult time, helping me prepare for the future. My parents were my main source of strength"" The difficulty of the transition is a common experience for most ex-cadets as they leave behind a place, they once called home. Moinul elaborates, ""A lot of cadets experience something akin to Stockholm syndrome. Both the good and bad memories resurface. But over time, you adapt. You make new friends, set new goals, and find a new rhythm to life."" It is common to assume that cadet college alumni will pursue a career in the military, but not every cadet dreams of donning the uniform. ""Like most cadets, I said yes to joining the military in grades seven and eight. Even in grade 12, when the then Chief of Army asked me, I said yes but that wasn't entirely true,"" Moinul remarked. ""By grade 10, I had decided to study at IBA, DU. Since then, I never seriously considered the military or government services."" For others, the allure of the military career faded as time went on. Mezbah Ul Islam, trade marketing specialist at Coca Cola Icecek (CCI) Bangladesh and ex-cadet from Jhenidah Cadet College reflects, ""People started calling me 'major' after I joined cadet college. Initially, I planned to join the armed forces to fulfil my father's dream. But in class nine, during a career session with an ex-cadet from The World Bank, we were encouraged to explore other opportunities. That session changed my perspective, and I decided to aim for IBA.""  On the other hand, Nirjhor*, an officer of the Bangladesh Army, had a different path. ""I never planned on joining the army. I even hated the idea of it. I used to think about spending my days at DU, TSC, and university campuses. I wanted to be a doctor and help people. It was something both my dad and I wanted. However, peer influence prompted me to leave my medical aspirations behind and join the army. I wanted to become self-dependent quickly, and the military seemed like the right option. I kept regretting those three years at the Bangladesh Military Academy (BMA) because I loved sleeping. Ever since my cadet life began, however, I have had to wake up at 5 AM."" Adjusting to life after cadet college is often a challenge for ex-cadets accustomed to the routine. Moinul notes, ""Though I wish I could return to those days, cadet life was a small, insular world. The reality outside is much more complex. But somehow, we manage."" Nirjhor echoes this sentiment. ""In cadet college, we said what we felt. But outside, there's a gap between what you say and how people interpret it. It makes life more complicated."" Even mundane aspects like food and transportation can become hurdles. Sumon shares, ""We used to have very well-maintained, balanced daily meals. On some days, we had special meals. We had dedicated teachers and staff to ensure the quality of food. So we never really had to worry about meals. But after starting university, I had a tough time adjusting to the food arrangement. There were times when I was 10 minutes late for lunch and the food had run out at the canteen. Whereas in cadet college, the meal was laid down on the table. All we had to do was sit and have our lunch. After I started living on my own outside the campus, I even had to find restaurants in search of a better daily meal. The beginnings of my undergrad were extra troublesome because of this."" With these bittersweet memories, all cadets move on to the next stage of their lives, carrying the lessons, friendships, and resilience they gained during their cadet years. It also prepares cadets for the challenges of the world outside. The bonds formed during that time stays strong, shaping a unique identity that every cadet holds close. No matter where life takes them – whether it's the military, corporate offices, or other fields – they remain part of one big community. Reflecting on the cadet experience, Mezbah shares a word of advice for aspiring cadets. ""Cadet colleges make you an all-rounder, not a specialist,"" he explains. ""If you want to be just a scientist, musician, or sportsman, cadet college might not be the best fit. But if you want to explore all of these options at once, cadet college is the right place for you."" His words capture the essence of cadet life – a place where students are not only prepared academically and physically but also encouraged to grow into versatile and adaptable individuals. While it's not easy, this experience lays a foundation that helps cadets succeed in whatever path they choose. *Name has been changed upon request

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/news/passion-practicality-and-pursuing-undergraduate-minor-degree-3840186","Of passion, practicality, and pursuing an undergraduate minor degree","As an undergraduate student who can barely deal with the pressure of a single major, witnessing some of my peers pursuing a minor programme, an option allowing students to venture outside their primary course of study, is intriguing. Why is a minor degree sought by some, knowing an extra discipline is going to impose an additional chapter to an already stressful academic life? Is it a calculated move to embellish their resume and boost their employability? Or is it driven by an intrinsic quest for knowledge reinforced by sheer passion? Moonim Ahsan, a fourth-year student at BRAC University, currently pursuing a minor degree in Computer Science, says, ""Choosing a minor programme was easy for me. From a young age I have been fascinated with computers. While my love for my major, Economics, knows no bounds, I couldn't help but feel a sense of ""what if"" whenever I thought about learning more about computers and software."" ""My interest and curiosity were the most significant factors in making this decision. Yet, I believe that my employability will be greatly enhanced once I am done with both degrees. At the moment, however, I am simply focused on learning. As long as that is fulfilled, I will consider this to be a successful decision,"" he adds. Faculties have the unique perspective of observing just how instrumental a minor programme can be in the vocational progress of students. Dr Wasiqur Rahman Khan, chair and professor at BRAC University's Economics and Social Sciences department, clarifies, ""The option of a minor programme is there for students interested in the pursuit of a more specific subject. It is a complementary qualification. Students must decide to what extent they intend to use it and whether it's for academia or employment. I've had students who went on to pursue their master's based on their minor rather than their major, simply because the former caught their interest more.""  Additionally, Dr Wasiqur remarks, ""If the objective of the minor is career-centric, students should select a minor programme based on their desired field or industry. Particularly in Bangladesh, employers, especially those in MNCs, look at the broad aggregates. They don't scrutinise your transcript. They'll prioritise your skillset, which can be augmented by a minor degree."" He further states, ""The content of a major programme is never fully utilised at a job setting, at most 20 to 30 percent of it is used. Hence, students should pick a minor programme which adds to this percentage."" Nonetheless, not everyone seeks a minor degree for career prospects. For Ibshar Khan, a fourth-year student at North South University, pursuing a minor degree in English Literature has become a comforting endeavour. ""Reading has always been a cherished tradition in my family. When I was younger, every month, without fail, my mom would take me to the local bookstore to pick out a new book. Fast forward to sophomore year, when everyone around me advised against choosing Literature as a minor, I let my inner rebel make the decision for me. I opted for something that soothes my weary soul instead of a more conventional route,"" she says. The perks of going for a minor degree are not just limited to academic enrichment, though. Ibshar shares, ""I have a better rapport with the people I met through my minor than with those I've known for four long years in my major courses. Moreover, this minor curriculum has probably done more for my personal growth than I ever anticipated. It has taught me to peel back the intricate layers of a book and see them as more than just stories. Literature now feels like context, history, and, most of all, truth. It has given me insights about not just the world but also myself. I've discovered individualism as well as a stronger sense of purpose and belonging. Safe to say, this minor programme has certainly boosted my emotional intelligence and that's far more valuable for me than intellect alone."" For faculty members like Dr Nazia Manzoor, assistant professor and chair of North South University's English department, the enthusiasm of students pursuing Literature as a minor is a joy to witness. ""I have had students repeatedly express that the endeavour feels like a warm welcome, being able to talk about texts in an inclusive manner within a classroom. As an instructor, it is really gratifying to know that we have been able to cultivate an environment which is comforting to students from all backgrounds."" She adds, ""University is perhaps the last opportunity you're going to get to experience and explore things that you are excited about. Once you finish it, your education becomes very specific as you start focusing more on becoming an expert, instead of having a general education in anything. It really is the last opportunity in life to do something just for the fun of it, just for the joy of it. So do it. Take that art class, do that English minor or whatever you've set your heart to."" Yet, in the digital era, where a world full of knowledge can be accessed with just a click, is a minor programme – which warrants extra time and money – a viable alternative?  Moonim says, ""I have enrolled myself in countless online courses and invested a hefty sum of money. The outcome is always zero because I struggle to stay committed. It's difficult to hold myself accountable after failing when there is nothing apparent at stake, like grades. On the other hand, a proper academic setting, bonding with your classmates, connecting with the faculty members, getting productive feedback, and trying to meet their expectations is more rewarding and fulfilling for me. I always perform a lot better under such circumstances."" However, instructors encourage the blend of both worlds. Dr Wasiqur notes, ""It's a very good thing that there are numerous courses online which can supplement the knowledge of students. When it comes to virtual learning, I would suggest students to focus on requisite knowledge, not something already covered by their minor or major programmes. This way they can keep on broadening their skill sets. Students must practise wisdom when it comes to exploring these options.""  Even so, balancing two different curricula is not without challenges. Dr Wasiqur reveals, ""Students often want to take courses from other departments such as Anthropology or English because they are intrigued by the content or want to boost their grades. However, having a minor degree can restrict students from doing so. For instance, if a student is doing a minor in Mathematics, it will be difficult for them to also take their desired courses in Sociology, Biology or any other department because their remaining credits will mostly be consumed by their minor courses, leaving limited options for other courses to be explored. Hence, these trade-offs must be considered carefully."" In a similar vein, Dr Nazia shares, ""Some students are unable to prioritise both major and minor curricula. Depending on the requirements of the major, the chosen minor programme can sometimes be a bit of an overreach. Additionally, if the minor is a passion project, which is often the case for English Literature, students end up enjoying the discipline so much that the major starts feeling like a chore and efforts toward it seem to dwindle."" Realistic expectations must be considered when pursuing a minor degree on the basis of passion according to Dr Nazia. ""Enjoy yourself and have fun while doing a minor but students must remember that they have to put in the work, do the labour and take the assignments seriously. Passion-driven minor programs may seem like a fun escape class but it is ultimately a class,"" she said. It seems that altogether, the pursuit of a minor degree doesn't just involve extra coursework. Rather, it's a reflection of a student's curiosity that can lead to genuine learning, enabling them to break away from the rigidity of what is outlined and explore other domains.

"Youth","https://www.thedailystar.net/campus/campus-life/news/photos-ramadan-hall-para-dhaka-university-3840336","In photos: Ramadan at Hall Para, Dhaka University","With the arrival of the holy month of Ramadan, the western residential area for students at Dhaka University (DU), also known as Hall Para, has been adorned with lights, flowers and crescent decorations. DU welcomes Ramadan in a well-organised and beautiful manner. For the last couple of years, however, the celebration of such Islamic festivities faced obstacles under the previous regime and its student wing. This year, the celebration has turned into an exciting and festive one since the campus re-achieved its freedom as an aftermath of the mass-uprising in July of last year. H.M.
