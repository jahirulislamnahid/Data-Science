# Data-Science
This is my data science course related projects which contains text pre processing from a web page(English newspaper web) then we do topic modeling and make different csv files to save then and we do in the beginning several operations on the dataset  
The document titled "Mid Term Project" for the course Introduction to Data Science (CSC4180) summarizes a data analysis project using a student placement dataset (placement_Data_Full_Class â€“ modified.csv) containing 216 records and 16 attributes.

ðŸ”¹ Summary (Short Description):
The project explores student academic and placement data to identify patterns related to employability. Key tasks include:

Pre-processing: Removing duplicates, handling missing and invalid values, normalizing salary, and converting categorical to numeric values.

Data balancing: Ensuring equal distribution of placed and not placed students.

Data splitting: Dividing data into training and test sets.

Descriptive statistics: Calculating central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (range, IQR, variance, std deviation) for SSC and MBA percentages.

Overall, itâ€™s a complete data cleaning and preparation pipeline for modeling placement prediction.
